College,Comment
ASU,"this is no different from every other $25 lyft coupon available, only you make money instead of my friends who have $25 codes. "
ASU,">Remember look for the cars with the pink mustaches. 

Actually drivers have been instructed not to put them on their vehicles since the mustaches make them targets for enforcement in Arizona. Uber > Lyft anyways"
ASU,Why is it every time I get a lyft they give me codes for free rides but these codes can only be used by someone who has never had a lyft? Obviously I won't be able to use it.
ASU,Lyft always been cheaper for me
ASU,"I'm not a huge fan of Uber as a business so I default to Lyft. If lyft is too expensive or gonna take too long, then I'll see what Uber can do, but it's rare they can do better."
ASU,"I have found Lyft to better for short distances, like within a 10-15 min drive and Uber for longer distances."
ASU,"I use both and use whoever is cheaper at the time. Surprisingly Uber has saved me a couple extra bucks compared to Lyft. 
For the airport though I still use the lightrail"
ASU,"If it's peak times and you need a ride to/from airport, neither. Call a real cab company like Yellow or Discount (or look for the airport line) and avoid the surge pricing. Taxi from airport to Tempe is about $15 and no surge premiums."
ASU,"LSA is pretty smack dab in the middle of campus so it depends on how far you want to walk/inconvenience your driver. Getting dropped off in the parking lot for First United Methodist Church on University is probably the easiest and it's a 5 minute walk to LSA. if you're coming from North/Northwest/West then I'd do that. 

If you're coming from South/Southeast/East then I would have them drop you off at ISTB/Campus bookstore. Which is about a 5 minute walk to LSA as well. Traffic can be balls on Orange St. however, especially during midday. Lots of cars and pedestrians.

Getting dropped off by WP Carey building on Lemon could also work. Bit longer walk and traffic will still be balls, but that's Tempe campus in a nutshell. 

Someone else will hopefully come in with a great tip."
ASU,"This is the Life Sciences wing A:

https://tours.asu.edu/tempe/life-sciences-center

Also install the MyASU app as it has a map and that can help you if you get lost"
ASU,Lyft and Uber will prompt you to select a drop off spot on campus. My advice is to just focus on getting on to campus and use google maps to walk to class.
ASU,The hero we need. **ASUMan**.
ASU,Congrats!
ASU,Congrats on your accomplishment.  Enjoy having your nights back.
ASU,Congrats bro. I’m happy for anyone that gets their degree and reaches for higher education. I couldn’t imagine driving Uber and going to school full time. I was lucky enough that I worked in hotels overnight so I just did all my homework while I “worked”. No better felling than going to school for the last time. Proud of you.
ASU,Congratulations on your hard work. On the road and in school. Hope ypu can work at Uber HQ and fix things you feel are not working right for drivers AND riders. 🎉🎊👍👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
ASU, Congrats. What did you study and how long
ASU,I’m proud of you!
ASU,Congratulations!
ASU,Pretty cool!
ASU,How did you even attend it full-time and get degree if you had to drive a lot to get the ASU for free?
ASU,Congratulations! Be proud of yourself! Such a great accomplishment! I’m hoping to go back to school soon as well!
ASU,Congratulations 🎈🎉🎊
ASU,Congratulations! I saw that the other day too. I thought it wouldn’t work because don’t they make you drive for them in order to keep it? Would make sense to me. How many hours were you driving with them to keep the tuition?
ASU,That actually gives me a reason to go ahead and do it. Thanks for posting this. Glad to hear it was challenging and you felt it was worth it. How long did it take?
ASU,Way to go 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼!!!
ASU,Congratulations
ASU,That’s awesome! Congrats!!
ASU,"Congrats OP, I'm hoping to be graduated from ASU in a year and a half using the same tuition reward. Going for electrical engineering, transferred in a bunch of credits as well"
ASU,"Great job, congratulations. I took advantage of it as well, I have 1 semester and I’ll graduate with a software engineering degree. The total cost was almost $100K. I paid less than $500 for books and other miscellaneous. 

Drivers if you can take advantage of this program."
ASU,"Congrats! You should point out that Uber will cover the ASU bill for the driver OR an immediate family member. My wife has been working on turning her Registered Nurse (RN with an Associates Degree) into a Bachelors of Science in Nursing @ ASU online for almost two years now, and she’s only got one more semester to go! Never paid a penny in tuition, only books. It’s a good deal!"
ASU,Good thing your done now  because with how upfront pricing is now I can't imagine keeping a high acceptance and low cancelation rate to get the free college and still make enough to be profitable....congrats friend .
ASU,Happy Holidays Brother
ASU,Congrats! Agree that don’t fully rely on rideshare for living. Most ppl won’t make it.
ASU,Congrats!!
ASU,Congratulations. Don't forget the tax bill comes for the tuition.
ASU,Congrats!
ASU,Congratulations OP👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
ASU,Man congrats! That's awesome!
ASU,What is your degree?
ASU,Just got 40 for 20 today
ASU,You got it right on time! Just about impossible to keep gold status now
ASU,Congratulations!
ASU,Congrats man.  That's way cool.
ASU,Sweet dude congrats! Now I don't know where your market is but get yourself to an ASU party! Definitely a fun bunch and legendary parties. Lol I only know this because a former coworker when there.
ASU,Wohaaaaa that is what I want to hear. Congratulations OP.
ASU,Congrats and good luck to you and your future endeavors.
ASU,Congratulations! It's nice to hear a success story with Uber's corporate name attached to it once in a while. I'm happy you recognized your own hard work here too though. Best of luck in the future.
ASU,"Can someone please explain, do. i ned to take all the courses? Can I take only those I want? Can I speed up the process of obtaining degree?"
ASU,Go Devils 😈
ASU,Congratulations 🍾🎉🎈🎊 🎁
ASU,[deleted]
ASU,Did the useless piece of paper increase your income?
ASU,"Free, ehhh…even with 2020 fare rates you could have probably driven less by cherry picking and paid for the school yourself. Congrats tho"
ASU,Well done!
ASU,Congratulations. 👍🏽
ASU,"Good for you, nice accomplishment!"
ASU,How many rides a week is that to maintain status?
ASU,"Don’t need college for a real job, just think about all these people that went to college and are paying back all that money with a low to mid level job… 😛 funny thing you can go into a trade job and make more then a teacher (example) that went to college.. that’s a real shame."
ASU,Congratulations 🍾 and thanks for the friendly reminder 👍✊
ASU,Context? What is ASU and what is the special deal they have with Uber?
ASU,How long did it take for you to achieve 3000 lifetime rides?
ASU,Congratulations 🎉🎉🎉🤍
ASU,"What if i failed in calculus, can i retake it. Or i have to pay for it."
ASU,I believe that Uber expanded the program to cover masters degrees on Jan 1st. I’d call ASU on Tuesday to confirm though.
ASU,Thought it had to be used for yourself or family? :D seems like you might need to start driving for uber yourself.
ASU,"So much wrong with this post but I’m not going to get into the ridiculousness of many of the details. I’ll just explain one thing to you that you need to understand. First off, it’s not a scholarship, it’s just free tuition that can be used by the driver or a driver’s immediate family. Just unbelievable that someone who is actually going to college has to be explained this. What you are asking is just not possible."
ASU,"Fiction. You can only gift ASU to siblings, spouses and children."
ASU,time to apply for student loans
ASU,I thought I declined a lot of rides. 20% AR? What kind of rides are you even fishing for?
ASU,I just completed my degree thanks to this program.  It was awesome.  You apply and Uber pays for everything except books.  I spent 2 years in this program.  Graduated May 8th with a BA in psychology.
ASU,"I'm doing this right now though I'm taking the summer off. Studying Software Engineering. Uber pays EVERYTHING except books. There's no catch, no 'gotcha!"" It's just they pay everything except books.

Well there is a catch, you do have to keep uber pro status the entire time. So if you're a driver who can't make money without cherry picking rides you will not be able to stay qualified. Other than that it's good."
ASU,You have to pay just to apply lol
ASU,"I'm midway through a degree. The experience is underwhelming...90% of the material is publicly available books and even YouTube playlists. They also have software that trains you in subjects like advanced math, statistics, even psychology....no teacher required! I'm commonly thinking ""Does anyone work at this campus? What do professors do all day?"" Apparently the campus has some labs that serve as classes as well...no professor required.

Anyway, you can try it if you want something to do when you're not working that's not watching TV and playing video games. My big concern is: will the degree be worth anything? Or will employers be like ""That's nice, now drive me to the airport LOL""?"
ASU,"Are you allowed to just take courses, without pursuing a degree. I suppose you can just do that, but would that be frowned upon? I am in highschool currently thats why I ask"
ASU,"Uber Eats only drivers get it at 1000 deliveries.

Uber drivers, with or without the delivery option, get it at 3000 trips.


They use two similar, but different, rewards programs."
ASU,"“In addition to earning points, you must maintain certain ratings to earn Gold, Platinum, and Diamond rewards. The requirements vary by region. Please check the Driver app for more information.”

As with just about everything uber, shit varies market to market.  Check the requirements in the app"
ASU,Had anyone ever get it?
ASU,"I've completed 33 credit hours at ASU online since I started in Fall of 2019.  I'm on track to graduate in December of 2021.  This has been a great opportunity to finally complete what I started 18 years ago.  

Only thing you really have to pay for out of pocket is books and getting your transcripts from previous schools, if applicable.   Uber paid the application fee.  They pay the tuition and fees after any grants you qualify for, hence the reason you have to fill out the FAFSA (Starbucks employees getting their ASU benefit have to do the same thing).  Even if you don't qualify for anything on FAFSA, they will still pay your tuition and fees.  

The programs available are at:   [https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/](https://asuonline.asu.edu/online-degree-programs/undergraduate/)"
ASU,Good for you to not get into student debt.
ASU,What deodorant you use?
ASU,Just hit my 3k rides looking to take advantage of this.  Are there any fees involved?  Books?  What sort of programs do they have?
ASU,Im on the grind to complete my 3000 trips. Im currently at 550 trips. I want to go for computer information system. I just hope they dont end this program before I get a chance.
ASU,3k rides minimum to take advantage of this?? Sounds amazing!
ASU,So you say Arizona State University or do you just say HPVU?
ASU,Are there any stipulations? I have a BA in media communications but I would love to go back to school and study something else on Uber’s tab. I’ve done 10k rides.
ASU,I really wish they would offer graduate programs online. I'd love to get a Masters degree for almost nothing.
ASU,Congrats! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
ASU,Yes but I don’t know any one who sponsor me
ASU,Was your mascot a broken condom?
ASU,Is applying for those grants very time consuming or difficult?
ASU, I qualify for the ASUniversity but I haven’t done enough deliveries. 😩
ASU,"Do UberEats deliveries count towards the 3,000 rides required or does it strictly have to be passengers?"
ASU,[deleted]
ASU,How many times have you been fucked on a house boat?
ASU,Did you write your dissertation on the collective work of Red Bull?
ASU,"OK dumb dumb, get your batchelors, then get your masters.  Perhaps then you will have the cerebral horse power to continue this conversation.  Right now, your just tio stupid to accept anything that I say.  Hey, Stupid people need live too; I get that.

Moving on, have a great weekend. 😊"
ASU,2200 more trips to go....ty for this thread! was really curious whether the grind was worth it or not. really seems like it is.
ASU,[deleted]
ASU,Do they cover just the first year or the completion of your degree in full following several years?
ASU,"Hope you see this, but do they ask for gpa or ACT scores when applying? I’m hoping to sign my mom up but she’s an immigrant with most of her past academic scores/gpa lost."
ASU,I’m at 2200 rides! I’m grinding to get to 3000🥹😮‍💨⬆️
ASU,I hope it is OK to reopen this discussion. I'm curious if you had any credits transfer from your previous education?
ASU,Do they help with HOUSING MOST IMPORTANT LIKE STUDIO OR 1br
ASU,question about the scholarship did you have 2 and did they update to cover the full amount? i signed up and enrolled in classes but the amount for the asu uber eats scholarship doesn’t cover the full amount. i have a ticket for final aid and spoke to my success coach but they didnt know much about it. i curious if this happened to you.
ASU,How long does it takes you to finish it?
ASU,"Hey, can you still pull out loans for books and expenses? Like you can get like 5k a semester (cash or check that goes into your bank account) is that a thing?"
ASU,Do you knoe if the progrem includes Master Programs?
UF,I’ve been here for 3 years now and never realized this was a thing so I wanted to share!
UF,The amount of money I've wasted...
UF,"When I first saw it in my email I 100% thought it was a phishing scam, didn’t realize till later it’s actually a thing"
UF,Damn I didn't know this. Thank you!
UF,[removed]
UF,This is a actually so great thank you!
UF,"So when in the proper zone, is it best to Lyft instead of snap? Snap instead of Lift?"
UF,"Its 50% off between those hours but they also give u some free rides! Every year I think I get 5 free rides, it’s so awesome. Sometimes tho it gets really busy and u have to take an uber or wait super long"
UF,"I’m shocked so many people don’t know about the UF Lyft pass. My friends constantly complain about how expensive Uber is and REFUSE to download Lyft even though I keep telling them about it! 

Anywhere on campus for like a dollar or two. It’s awesome!"
UF,How does it work? Do we need a code or something?
UF,"Just a warning to others - I tried to use this last Friday night around 10:30 and Lyft couldn't find a driver (tried twice over 40 mins, just ended up paying full price for an Uber before it got even later) so be sure to have a backup plan!!"
UF,How do I get this
UF,I have 15$ lyft passes for 5$ dm me
UF,"A really cool partnership between UF and Lyft! See below:

https://taps.ufl.edu/alternative-transportation/uf-safe-rides/"
UF,for abt a month or so lyft + UF gave me like 25% off all my rides that fell into this like “boundary circle” and it was very helpful considering i used to not go far. maybe they’re offering it again?
UF,Its the n-word pass when using Lyft.
UF,"Haven’t used Lyft but assuming it has similar safety measures to Uber, you should be able to share your location with family/friends and/or reach out to a safety line or 911 if needed. Plus their background checks are pretty stringent so far as I know. I’d just make sure to schedule the ride ahead of time if possible and be prepared for a pretty expensive fare since that’s prob going to be over $100+tip lol"
UF,Im also a girl at UF and I use EZ airport shuttle service coming back from JAX. It’s a shuttle service a lot of UF students use. I usually talk to this guy named terry in charge
UF,https://www.ezshuttle.net/ I have heard these people are good.
UF,Did you try seeing if there's any busses or anything?
UF,That’s an 1 1/2-2 hr ride from Jax to campus. Try red coach or some bus service
UF,"Me and my family used lyft fairly frequently around gainesville and often ran into the same couple of drivers. there were only two times i felt uncomfortable, but i wasn't alone both times and those were two drivers we'd never seen before."
UF,I didn’t know this! Thank you!
UF,Thanks for posting! Those times are super confusing. Can anyone explain them clearly?
UF,Are these Lyft safe rides free for those hours?
UF,If you already had one does it automatically reapply because I haven't gotten another email about it.
UF,"Obviously scooter and driving in a car are different than literally paying for Uber to get to and from class, and this post is a friendly PSA — but, just try out the bus if you don’t rely on it already. They’re fairly routine in their stops, they get you from point A to point B, you can read a book or watch TikTok while you’re on the move, and you don’t have to drive — and if your stop is a few blocks away from your destination you even get some exercise in. 

I definitely could have physically afforded to pay for Ubers to and from class and not been *completely* broke at UF (I’m a very recent grad) — but that’s just utterly wasted money if you live anywhere around campus in the usual student housing complexes. And, the vast majority of people (myself included) cannot even imagine justifying relying on ride share services to get to class regularly because of $$$. I’m surprised that’s a thing. Obviously if it’s an emergency, yeah. But are students relying on Lyft so much they need a reminder to like, find any other non-$20 way to get to campus?

If so, UF needs to pump more money into RTS"
UF,Yes!!!! r/fuckcars !!!!!!
UF,what’s happening to the hub?
UF,Are the new restrictions just for like parking in that area near the hub to drop people off or are they restricting driving on those roads altogether?
UF,Why does this school increasingly just make life harder for students smh
UF,"It’s Hitch and if  anyone wants to help a homie out and use my referral link because I’m broke here it is :D 

https://www.ridehitch.com/r/CVIhbsJbKJ"
UF,hitch
UF,"I used it for GNV -> JAX the other day and it was pr smooth, similar experience to Uber

It doesn’t let you drop the pin in an exact location tho, so if you’re trying to get picked up from an apartment community call your driver and tell them where you are"
UF,Use whatever one is cheaper and you're good to go. I compare prices on the Google maps tab for ride-sharing
UF,"I always prefer Lyft, it tends to be slightly cheaper, granted I don't use rideshare often. I've never had any issues with either though."
UF,"if you care about political stuff, some people have been boycotting uber due to some scandals in recent years. this is of course a personal decision and does not affect the system whatsoever, but it's something to think about. ([\#deleteuber 2017](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/why-deleteuber-and-other-boycotts-matter/517416/), [boycott uber 2019](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boycott-uber-2019-faces-boycott-threats-after-ceo-calls-jamal-khashoggis-murder-a-mistake/))

i've only had good experiences with uber, been using it for 2 years now. i haven't had to pay more than $8 for rides on uber, but then again i tend to use it on sat & sun mornings when it is less busy.  i can't speak for lyft because i simply can't be bothered to download a second rideshare app lol. but these drivers know they're in a college town and are usually pretty friendly. :)

edit: formatting & links"
UF,"its cheap and convenient.  Surge pricing sucks but i just wait for it to go down.  Like if i wanna go home like 1:30am and surge is crazy, i just hang out with my buds until like 2:30am and then the pricing is normal."
UF,"Free access to LinkedIn learning, all kinds of on-demand short courses, some will give you badging credentials on your LinkedIn profile when you complete them (programming, Adobe suite, excel, marketing, etc.) https://training.it.ufl.edu/linkedin/"
UF,I’m pretty sure at lake Wauburg UF students have free access to rock climbing and other activities
UF,"Free bus rides; free newspaper subscriptions like the NYT; private access to Lake Wauburg with free kayak and canoe rentals; free access to the entire UF library database which includes scholarly journals, historical records both physical and digital, and all types of film; etc. There’s likely more but that’s what I’ve taken advantage of in my time here."
UF,Free condoms and period hygiene products at the Student Healthcare Center.
UF,"I love this topic — here’s my list so far:

• DigitalTheatre+ (stream high quality theatre shows for free)

• The Field & Fork Pantry (free groceries to help reduce food insecurity)

• All of the UF libraries (they have regular books too)

• SG-funded bike shop below Reitz (sooooo underrated)

• The Molm Family Career Closet (borrow professional clothing)

• Free resume printing of up to 20-25 (?) copies on nice paper during Career Fair week

• GatorDays (SG takes students to excusions outside of GNV)

• Marston Tools and Technology Lending ([link](https://marston.uflib.ufl.edu/services/tech-and-tools/) bc everyone should check it out)

• [The Meat Processing Center](https://animal.ifas.ufl.edu/facilities/meat-processing-center/) (eat UF-grown proteins)

• The Observatory (open on Fridays for public viewing, weather permitting)"
UF,"I think all students get WSJ, Economist, and NYT for free, business students get a bunch of good financial databases (Refinitiv, CapIQ, IBISWorld, Statista, etc)."
UF,You get Microsoft 365 for free including a TB of one drive space for backup. Makes OneNote the perfect companion.
UF,check out the uf libraries website and you can find a ton! i’ve used it a few times. you may have to go on the uf vpn to get access if you aren’t on campus
UF,"Access to a shit ton of academic journals

Intramural/recsports stuff including free Fitness assessments 

Gator nights

CWC services 

The two museums including butterflies

All uf sports events except football

UfApps has a lot of software for free

UF,I'd like to know this as well! :)
UF,Alot of academic scholar resources for research papers and publications. They usually have a sign in with institutions button
UF,Free Microsoft office on multiple devices
UF,Bloomberg terminals which usually cost 10K I think you can reserve time on. Gives access to all sorts of data.
UF,"$5/month for spotify premium, hulu, and showtime"
UF,New York Times subscription :)
UF,"Don't forget to use your Student ID to get access to GitHub Education, it has great stuff for Tech learning and practice."
UF,You can get a cheap Grammarly Premium account for 3 dollars a month. It requires calling the UF help desk to get them to send you the access key. But it’s definitely worth it for my dyslexic ass
UF,Clear offers all students a four year membership at a heavily discounted price.
UF,50% off lyft ride from 9pm - 3 am most days of the week. U should get an email soon with the link

UCLA,"Can you imagine it would be annoying and time consuming to drive through campus? Because if so, that may be the reason. 

The area I drive in has a few colleges and some of the campuses are really annoying and time consuming. Like it may take me 10 minutes to drive through with all the speed bumps and stop signs. That’s -0 minutes I could do 1-2 complete rides instead."
UCLA,Maybe because y’all don’t tip
UCLA,Call a cab
UCLA,I fucking got stuck there while they were doing this stupid ass dorm week or some shit fucking terrible I almost asked the passenger just to walk the rest of the way so I can flip around and get out.
UCLA,Definitely walk off campus. There are several campuses and apartment complexes I won’t pick up from if the passenger isn’t out front. The speed bumps are too much and take way too much time.
UCLA,What's your rating?
UCLA,"Where I am there is only two colleges, one is pretty open and there’s not a huge issue but ones gated and hard to get around so doing ride share is a nightmare. I have more of an. Issue with military bases and people not realizing I can’t pick them up or drop off there (with once exception where I got a contractors badge)."
UCLA,Order Lux I bet they will
UCLA,"Walk off campus into Westwood.  If possible, take a bus for a bit closer to your destination, and then get an Uber/Lyft from there."
UCLA,All this before upfuck pricing.  Those percentages in the study are even further apart now.
UCLA,Full report: https://www.labor.ucla.edu/publication/for-hire-vehicle-data-new-york-city/
UCLA,"“ There was wide variation in what percent the company took of the passenger fare. In February 2019, the company took 30% or more of the fare on about 9% of the rides. In April 2022, the company took a 30% or more cut of the passenger fare for 29% of all rides.”

&#x200B;

interesting little stat, the last one!

The implication is that 70% of rides (in that Month), uber took less than 30% of the “fare”.

of course, between the 2019 and 2022, the business model changed (given the introduction of guarantees) Justifying some change to funds collection."
UCLA,Oh the convergence is coming.. mark my words
UCLA,"Basically, rather than walk across campus, they just call an Uber or Lyft to get dropped off at their next class. And it's cheap enough that this is a common thing."
UCLA,"Students used to pay me 3 bucks per uber trip to drive them 3 buildings down the road. But that'd take 15min to do. So I ended up pretty much working at minimum wage. The worst of em would want me to cart them and 4+ of their friends. Sorry man, you need an Uber XL. So then I get shit over not accommodating them. 

The worst was after the bars let out and they all wanted rides a few blocks back to the fraternity houses/dorms. The worst. 

Hated ubering at Tulane/Loyala. Most pretentious people I ever met."
UCLA,"I work at an Australian University spread out over a large area. They have a free shuttle bus circling the place all day which can be handy - depending on which way you are going. One problem is the roads circle the University, they don't criss cross through the centre. 

For us workers we usually walk to meetings in other buildings and this might take ten minutes. It adds up."
UCLA,"They should ban Uber and lyft on campus. Make those fuckers walk, bike, or skate."
UCLA,lazy fuckers
UCLA,Wish that had been available when I was in uni. One mile to go anywhere! It was terrible.
UCLA,Lazy cocks.
UCLA,So lazy! The campus is not even that big relatively speaking. It is the smallest campus in the UC system.
UCLA,No offence but your generation could use the exercise.
UCLA,"Why walk 15 minutes in nice warm weather? Wait 13 on your ass then take a 2 minute car ride using Papa's credit card. It's all part of the social media curse. I actually know a kid that commit suicide because his uber rating dropped so low drivers wouldn't pick him up. He would use it to literally go 3-5 mins of distance 2 plus times a day, so a few blocks."
UCLA,"I take the bruinbus to campus. Only really use lyft in the rare occasion I need to get home quick. 

>The report may also point up the conflicted attitudes of a younger generation that has become somewhat dubious about the automobile because of its damaging impact on the environment and urban traffic, and yet has also embraced ride-hailing as a quick and inexpensive way of getting around.

I work for lyft during the vacations and have done around 900 rides, not alot but certainly enough to get a feel for who takes lyft. out of 20-30 rides I will get people ages 18-29 sure, but I see older folks and senior citizens all the time. Everyone uses rideshare apps fuck off. 

Also, the larger problem with Los Angeles if you are referring to smog and traffic related issues is your goddamn horrid transportation system. It's impossible to get anywhere in Los Angeles without a car. From UCLA, to La Boom in huntington park took almost 5 hours via bus and multiple times I had to get off and then walk maybe half a mile just to fucking transfer. I made the same trip, picked up a friend, got food, and got there in around 2 hours when I drove my car. 

How about you improve your transportation system, build more metro stations, bus routes, and other forms of more efficient transportation before you blame students waking up late and needing to get to class on time. "
UCLA,"I have taken many a $3 trip from my apt to my job on north campus. It’s just so freakin hilly and basically a workout for me to get there. But I would absolutely stop if there was a bus that could take me there. I really just want a stop on Gayley or Strathmore that goes to Wyton Circle. UCLA just has to spend money on other frivolous things. 

Also I hope I’m not being discriminatory or anything but a lot of my international friends only take Ubers to get to campus, like it’s a regular everyday thing for them."
UCLA,"Blame the students when 70% of global emissions are caused by, specifically, 100 corporations. Fuck off.

Edit: specifics"
UCLA,As in less traffic and pollution?
UCLA,Fuck off
UCLA,"Lol rich people ruining the world, what else is new"
UCLA,i uber/lyft to and from my work 3x per week for the last two quarters and have never had an issue! share your location with someone you trust and just be aware!
UCLA,"I’ve done more rideshare (lyft/uber) than anyone else I know, including a lot at night. It’s fine the vast majority of the time. Sometimes they say ignorant things (I’m Asian) and I’ve heard female friends who have reported some weird behavior. But it is physically safe!! As the other person said share your location with someone and you will be fine"
UCLA,I uber 3x a week at night because of work. haven’t had many issues. there’s the occasional odd person but just make sure someone has your location at all times if you’re really worried about it and you’ll be okay
UCLA,[deleted]
UCLA,"If the situation seems creepy, I always like to take out my phone and do a fake call saying that I’ll be right there and sorry I’m late, so the driver thinks somebody is waiting for me. You can even say “I sent you my ETA on GPS”, that way the driver thinks that somebody is waiting for you and activity tracking you! It’s a good idea to share your location with somebody anyways in addition to that."
UCLA,"i take lyft to and from campus, to any plots, basically everywhere. i’ve had creepy behavior, but you should be totally fine safety wise"
UCLA,"I'm a frequent uber/lyft user and have had next to no problems. Also, as a woman I have never felt truly unsafe. If you're feeling unsure you can share your location with someone. I would also identify spots on your route where you can potentially stop and pick up a different ride if needed. My least ""safe"" experience was in Berkeley with a driver who seemed either tired or high and was swerving a bit. I had him drop me off at a store, left a report on the app and requested a different driver."
UCLA,"i don’t do it anymore, but i used to work at a department store closing, and always used uber, also never had an issue !! i would share my trip location with my roommate just to give us both peace of mind, but yeah :)"
UCLA,"As someone who has had internships in Little Tokyo and had to take the bus (sometimes in the evenings), I think Lyfts are great if you can afford it (def better than taking the bus lol). I’ve had a couple weird instances of being hit on. Something I’ve done many times to help alleviate the anxiety of riding at night is have someone on the phone (like maybe a family member or friend), especially if your Lyft driver makes you uncomfortable. I have friends who have codewords in case they need someone to call them to get them out of an iffy situation."
UCLA,"I think those are fine, but does anyone have experience with Uber pool? Because it’s so much cheaper but like what if you get stuck with a bad person"
UCLA,Never had a bad experience myself. Keep to yourself and be aware. Be safe!
UCLA,[deleted]
UCLA,"yeah this happens a lot at peak hours when everyone’s trying to get a rideshare. i often just select “wait and save” and do homework in my room or play videogames until it says they’re close. usually works for me although it can take a bit. usually if you wait until 6 or 7, getting one is a lot easier too"
UCLA,Yup it’s super common fuck Uber and Lyft
UCLA,In front of SV Rec parking garage
UCLA,"I always used the Gateway plaza location, because it's the one easiest to find for Uber/Lyft drivers not familiar with campus. If you're close enough, it's a great pick-up location."
UCLA,"My Lyft drivers just meet me where I ask for a pickup. The designated locations are intended to improve the flow of traffic. 

Good intentions, but a hopelessly ineffective solution. "
UCLA,Pick up at sunset canyon is actually ridiculous. It's a single lane with no where to pull over. It's actually really dangerous since cars have to go in opposing traffic to get past if drivers just stop there
UCLA,"Uber has its own designated locations around UCLA. For instance, Dickson court is the usual pickup spot for north campus and has its own option. You can always select specific roads if you want for places such as the dorms. Shouldn’t be a problem. "
UCLA,"Whenever I've used them, the driver picks me up a little bit further away. Idk if this is because it's difficult for them to get to the location, or another reason."
UCLA,"No, and you can blame California's new legislation that essentially kills the gig economy for that.  Uber has already gotten rid of their upfront pricing scheme (except for pooling), and Lyft will no longer have the $5.49 promotion. 

 It was already costly for Lyft before (they were fine burning money for increased market share) but now it's entirely cost prohibitive.  It's not coming back."
USC,"shryft is the essentially the same process as fryft, only now being that the rides you book will most likely be shared w another person- usc student or not. fryft was nice bc you could have a whole car to yourself, and basically 2-3 of your friends could ride along. now you can only have 1 other person. i was a first year fall 2021 and had only known fryft, but it was changed (back) to shryft spring 2023 (most likely bc covid policies were starting to loosen up, and fryft probably costs usc a ton more money). shryft was horrible in the beginning though, bc waiting for one could literally take hours, compared to minutes w fryft. i definitely think the system is better now though, since i haven’t had to wait nearly as long towards the end of the semester. once you book a ride, you’re automatically either put in a car w 1-2 others, or you may have the car to yourself, or pick up another person. it works 7 days a week 6pm-2am, but home fb games and other coliseum events affect that. hope this helps!"
USC,"People are being dramatic. I’ve never once been in a shryft with a non-usc student, and although sometimes they can take a while and being inconvenient, they are SO SO SO SO MUCH SAFER than walking alone through south central at night. Saves you a ton of money too."
USC,Shryft is much less safe and anxiety-free bc ur with a random person and possibly not sober. It also takes years to get a ride and lies about how soon it'll be
USC,I got the email invitation for this rideshare. But I’m still confused. Do we have to live on campus or what is the mile radius we can be from campus and still be order a ride?
USC,I stopped using the program once they switched over to shryft
USC,What is this? Ate grad students allowed to use it?
USC,"Yes, USC still does the share rides for the students with that schedule. But is it summer and There is literally very few students there. It’s a ghost town. There’s a bunch of drivers parked, waiting for pings and nothing."
USC,"Shared still exists? I disabled those requests nearly a year ago and also haven't had to deal with switches and auto-queue bullshit for a couple months by now. Drivers, update your settings."
USC,I don’t think they’re receiving free share rides during summer. I tried doing this promotion and I wasn’t receiving anything. I was there for nearly 25 mins and nothing. I could be wrong though.
USC,"i believe they still do the ride program but it's just regular solo rides, not shared rides"
USC,Was there like 2 weeks ago and I got nothing. Way too many drivers sitting there even during the summer. I swear about 100 lyft drivers alone were camping it was insane I left after 30 mins driving around with no pings.
USC,"1. You can get tons of rides — it seems like they group them 2 or 3 pickups at a time, so when you finally get a ping you're making at least 2 stops. I hit 26 rides one night when I was trying to get the signup bonus. 

2. You won't make a lot of money — unless it's surging and/or a power zone, you're making little money. It's best for bonus hitting missions.

3. Your rating goes down — for whatever reason USC rides ding your rating. I'm at 5 stars after 566 rides so I know I'm doing something right, but consistently I get dinged on campus rides. It's the only place in LA where this happens. I'm not sure if students are high maintenance, or if their interface defaults at 4 stars?

4. Its crowded — anytime it's surging, the area is packed to the gills with drivers. During major surges I've sat for an hour without any hits. I've ended up walking around Trader Joes with the app on just waiting for a hit. "
USC,Interesting timing... UCLA just rolled out a $5.99 flat rate program with Uber for any rides within 5 miles of campus. 
USC,I had one week where I was aiming for PDB and ended up giving a bunch of rides for USC students and I believe that's when my rating went from 4.92 to a 4.72.. I don't know if it has to do with that program but I've avoided those rides and just don't accept Line rides from there ever.
USC,"Advantages:

Ddoing Lyft at USC is only good when working on a promotion. You usually get back to back rides around usc. The most I've done in a day was 30 rides. So if I can do so can you. Then again, students start using the Lyft app from 7pm to 2am. So it's better to get there around 630pm to be ready for rides.

Disadvantages:

You'll see a lot of lyft drivers with their emblem on during night time. So it'll take a while 2 get rides. But once you get a ride, you will get multiple rides since students only use lyft pool. Also, the pay is not good. There would be times where I pick up 3 students and get paid $2.62 or around $4.

Ps. When driving around usc...be careful lol lots of students are on their bikes and they pop out of nowhere!!!!!!"
USC,Was it a guy named Derek in a black Honda Insight?
USC,Happened to me as well.
USC,"This all happened to me too,  but how does the lyft driver exactly tip himself using the screen thing? This is the first I heard of this screen thing but I guess it happened to me too, because I never clicked the button and I thoguht it was some bug in the app. I tried contacting lyft but they never got back to me."
USC,Same! Except I had this happen with Nicholas in a Toyota Corolla!
USC,"I just checked all my lyfts from this weekend because of this post, happened to me too. With Edgar in a Toyota Corolla"
USC,"I’ve been noticing 1-2 unexpected tipping charges a month recently. I always assumed it was me being clumsy and hitting it accidentally, but I’ve also begun suspecting the screens. Sometimes the driver doesn’t have one in the backseat, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t keeping it up front and tipping themselves afterwards.

I can’t find any way to contact Lyft support. I go to report a “billing issue” or whatever, and they run some automated check on my recent rides and tell me everything looks okay and I can’t dispute anything. You could file a dispute with your credit card company, but that probably means having your account deactivated."
USC,"If anyone else has experienced this issue, I would recommend contacting their support on Twitter, @AskLyft. They’ve been pretty responsive for me so far. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the app, a driver scheme, or whatever else, but enough people need to contact support so that they realize it’s a recurring issue and not just people clicking the wrong button by mistake."
USC,"I just got a notification that I apparently tipped Hector $28 for a $24 ride! I usually tip $5, and definitely wouldn't have tipped that much."
USC,"To everyone who has noticed this happen, I strongly suggest you go into your Lyft app settings and double check if default tip is turned on, either at $5 or a percentage. If you contact Lyft support they will likely have you check this first so good to rule it out so you can say ""I already checked and default tip is turned off"". 

Lyft added this setting a while ago and you may not have noticed. It is currently only available for iOS users so people on Android might not see it in settings.

Tagging /u/tw822 so they see this and maybe want to consider adding it to the text of their post just in case."
USC,I noticed it often too but was able to remove it before rating on my phone. Had a few $15 even.
USC,"[Another Instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/xyxeu9/lyft_automatic_tips/) , where I faced the same fraud !"
USC,"This is happening to me too but when I contacted the Lyft customer support they said they cant help me if its a tip. Its frustrating talking to the Lyft customer support; the interface, the questions and the help, everything is shitty. I got frustrated at the whole situation, went through all five stages of grief and thought I made my peace until I saw this"
USC,This happened to me too. I was charged a $5 dollar tip 2 DAYS after I took a fryft (keep in mind it was one 0.2 miles away)
USC,"Well. If you file a complaint on the Lyft app, they will give you a 5 USD coupon in return. So, it balances out. They know that their drivers are expert scammers. So, in order to balance between reduction of driver numbers and customer dissatisfaction; they do this."
USC,"Happened to me with Hasan in a Toyota Corolla Hybrid  
How are you guys dealing with this issue?"
USC,"It isnt the screens, lyft is defaulting to a 5$ tip sometimes, and when we rate the driver we do not pay heed to this selection and complete the ride from our end. I got charged 5$ this way and realized it was my mistake. Idk why lyft suddenly started to default to 5$ randomly."
USC,No wayyy Derek got me twice 💀💀💀
USC,mario and macario got me 💀
USC,OMG NO WAY THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE and i tried contacting lyft support but they said since it was a tip they couldnt help me!!! i thought ive just been careless but … holy shit cant believe its a legit thing people are doing
USC,"Mine were from dudes named Oscar and Derek, the Lyft app doesn’t have any option to dispute tips so I went to the safety section and filed it there. I was able to call a Lyft representative and she refunded me both of the tips that were taken from me so you guys should try that!"
USC,I had this happen too. Its lyft. They are adding $5.00 tips to their drivers with 5 stars but using the customers to pay it. I am reporting this to my cc company. It’s the principle. They decided now they will reward their 5 star drivers but they use the customer money for it. I dont care about being banned from them. Uber is better anyway. Dont authorize people money without permission.
USC,Why don’t you usually tip?
USC,[removed]
USC,Don’t be an asshole and tip your ride share driver.
USC,"If you don't tip like at least $1.75 which is same as bus fare I have no respect for you cuz Lyft does not pay them enough lol hope he gets stopped but also hope Lyft is held accountable for not paying their drivers. He was prob sick of not getting tipped doing rides at the supposed University of Privileged Children, but that's def not okay to assume and do it himself."
USC,"This happened to me too! Fuck lyft man this is mow twice that this has happened!

This is malicious intent! We should fuck up lyft Twitter!"
USC,"I found the same problem. I got charged by Nicolas in August and thought it was my mistake, but just found another tip to Nicolas on Nov 1st. I’ll contact Lyft on twitter, but just wondering if anyone has reported the issue to our school? It’s definitely fraud."
USC,"This is kind of late, but will you guys stop blaming the drivers for this bs. I'm almost 100% certain it's not even the drivers ripping you off. Lyft is to blame. I know a driver who wasn't even getting 50% of his tips from Lyft. He found this out after a customer tipped him, then customer stayed in his car to make sure he got the tip. He never did receive it. Customer and my friend exchanged contact info and screenshots for proof. My friend contacted a lawyer and easy win for my friend in getting compensated well over 10k. Lyft settled out of court and Lyft didn't even deny the claim against them. This leads me to believe that the company itself is led by a bunch of crooks. They know it is cheaper to payout drivers who catch them stealing tips then to genuinely give drivers 100%. Moral of this story? I'd bet Lyft is charging customers tips and stashing the"
USC,Yeah it’s taken forever to get connected to a ride this week. Idk what’s up
USC,Might as well just walk to somewhere else in the Fryft zone if it's safe because it will be quicker.
USC,They take forever not just for Fryft but for Uber as well.
USC,"+1 on this. They should have atleast told me the time I need to wait properly, not just 1 min BS. I'm now tired of wasting 20 min everyday (and call Uber afterward). 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
USC,Seems like it's taking a lot longer this past week or 2
USC,I waited like 30 minutes for a paid Lyft before just cancelling
USC,"USC will either:

1.	have a contract in place and this will not affect them. 
2.	drop lyft and go back to Uber. 
3.	drop lyft and expand campus cruiser program instead."
USC,The return of fryft!
USC,Does this mean a reduction in that higher shryft fee imposed this upcoming academic year isn’t happening?
USC,Dummping Lyft!
USC,"Lyft driver here. If you tip, awesome. If you don’t, I understand. I love working the USC area because most of you guys are nice and polite, you make a stressful job easier. So thank you. Just don’t slam the doors when you’re getting off the car, and acknowledge your driver; we are humans, and we’re here to help you out. Stay awesome USC people."
USC,Just be polite. Tip is not a big deal tbh. Drivers understand you guys are in school. Treat people how you’d like to be treated.
USC,I’m a driver that comes to usc frequently and generally the students don’t tip.
USC,I always tip 2 dollars - but I would love to know what’s usc pays though. Yesterday there was a surge and it listed 30 bucks on receipt (all covered by usc) - does usc pay anything close to that amount - what does the driver make from that?
USC,"Tbh i used to but my trips are always so short like all <5 minutes. But tip if you can!

now i only do if the driver really goes out of their way to be friendly. Like when a driver wanted to know about my student experience and wished me good luck on finals"
USC,"I’ll tip when the driver get off to help me with the trunk, you know sometimes with a lot of bags from Ralphs"
USC,"If they go really above and beyond, yes. Usually no"
USC,Broke af 😕
USC,Too broke for that
USC,"Always tip your driver. 

Honestly these guys and gals are working full time on that app. The app absolutely considers the generosity of customers as part of their pay. Every little bit helps, even if it’s a buck. 

As many drivers have chimed in, they get it. Broke college students don’t tip much, if at all. But keep in mind (I know this from experience), Uber does everything it can to pass on the cost to the driver to limit their potential losses and increase profitability. 

No one is Ubering because they want to. Try and be kind if you can."
USC,Nope
USC,$10 every time
USC,yes lol they’re still lyft drivers…
USC,Debt and tip does not work in the same sentence
USC,"No. Some of my friends do, some don’t."
USC,"I always tip $5. I don't have a lot of money, but I figure I'm not paying for the ride, but I can at least pay a $5 tip. If I don't have money to tip, I can walk within the Fryft zone. I don't have a lot of money, but my mom raised me to be a good tipper."
USC,"Yes, I tip when I have to use it."
USC,Personal I love to see 3 bucks but I’m happy even with one dollar. 90% of people don’t tip at all so even a buck makes you in top 10 %  and it’s greatly appreciated !
USC,"$5 would be excellent. You have a safe ride, the driver is treated well. Win win."
USC,"Student rides are less than 2 miles, your driver makes 72 cents per mile. You will have a hard time finding a driver for lyft downtown. I've done 5k rides and live downtown and its only worth it for drivers if there is a surge price with the trip. Lyft doesn't have surge anymore.

During events, football games, frat lot rides etc, I turn lyft off because they offer no surge bonus.

All that being said, I and the other drivers appreciate you asking about offering a tip. Thanks"
USC,Free????? Looks like I'm switching back to the Uber app
USC,"$5 is good for short rides, under 15 minutes of destination drive time."
USC,$2-3. Any less and you'll feel stingy. Any more and you might as well take the bus.
USC,"$1,000,000"
USC,Don’t tip
USC,"60 cents per mile plus 20 cents per minute. (That's Uber) Therefore you should use the bus unless there are extra incentives for drivers on busy nights. Or new drivers desperate for any rides with guaranteed income.

In addition, go south or east is prohibited. $10 is recommended for any place other than West Hollywood. All is forgiven if you are dressed for a Bel Air house party like the students of the other U that is closer."
USC,ANYTHING!  Thank you!  👍
USC,"At least $5.  And drivers, stop promoting $1 tips."
USC,2 bucks sounds about right
USC,These rides are usually in a power Zone so  mines are like $6 per ride
USC,"It is called Fryft for a reason. Lyft pays them and your parents pay $60,000 for you to attend USC. Use the free benefits and don't do extra"
USC,"Hahaha I have this same offer (111 rides Fri to sun) except they only offered me an extra $130 for completing it...

😂😂

Lyft got jokes, that's for sure!!"
USC,That's too many rides in just 3 days
USC,"Normally I would say yes, but I believe this driver works that area with a strong and smart filtering strategy and sadly had ran into some issues. Check out his post and past market reporting comments, he is a good contributor 

Best of luck ✊

USC,Yeah USC can get this done  Friday and Saturday nights for sure. But do filler rides during the day for like 5 hours when when 6pm hits go straight to usc and just stay there. You can get 30/40 rides between 6pm and 2am over there
USC,Check USC's schedule. Some private schools are done for the semester this week.
USC,$15.50/per ride. Don't get overly excited.
USC,"No, it is not.  They will make it sure it doesn't happen.  I used to drive in that area.  12 hours for 3 days netted me around 90 rides."
USC,111 rides in 3 days? Wtf
USC,Will they even honor this?
USC,They’re smoking hardcore 🤣 that’s impossible

USC,Its not a bonus dont get tricked lol
USC,Only problem USC is semi adjacent to high crime areas
USC,Yes. Easily lol
USC,No
USC,Check local FB groups and local drivers you know. Chances are if you got it many others did as well. Dangle a big enough carrot so all drivers try and few can do it.
USC,Lmao
USC,It’s not a bonus it’s a guarantee and this is Lyft asking you to kill yourself . This is wrong
USC,Seems like the right call. Any reason they shouldn’t?
USC,And we can only add max one more person to our ride and I think it’s too cheap.
FSU,Yes. They’re always around at all times of day.
FSU,Yes you can. I have before for the airport and barely waited for pickup.
FSU,Yeah I just did it a week ago.
FSU,I got an Uber at 3:00 AM when I flew out Thanksgiving. You’ll be fine.
FSU,done it many many times before!
FSU,"i’ve done it before at 4am! if it makes you feel better, you can schedule the uber ahead of time"
FSU,"Tallahassee has a population of 200,000 people it’s not rural America with no Uber drivers lol"
FSU,"Today, Uber just added tipping. 

To be honest, the fact that you didn't have to tip in Uber is one of the things that made it attractive to use. The price I paid is the price I paid. I can give cash tips if I really feel like they went above and beyond, but the service and payment set-up was pretty straightforward. If drivers didn't like the cut they were getting then they could choose to drive less or not at all. The restriction in driver supply should cause prices to increase to make up somewhat for the lack of tipping. "
FSU,"[As a former driver](http://imgur.com/a/iYzve) for Lyft, I highly endorse them. Just don't try to make a doc off it as most people (at least in ATL) just wanted to get where they were going."
FSU,"So I hadn't taken either of these services on my own until actually having earned income in my account, and I am sure that some students can and do afford rideshare services, but that is a fairly small minority of students. I will say from experience that most students are either too ""poor"" (for lack of a better word) or too financially conscious to afford rideshares. That said, my two cents on Uber and Lyft for those who can afford to take them:

I've had more consistent (and usually positive) experiences with Uber, while my Lyft experiences have ranged from drunk/stoned drivers swerving off the side of the road at odd moments, and rambling motor mouths who make Travis Bickle look positively sane... to genuinely good drivers who take what they are doing seriously. I will follow up on this that Lyft does have the better business model and genuinely treats its drivers better, and is a lot more innovative in ways that Uber has been noticeably slow to pick up on. However, Lyft is definitely more of a gamble. 
"
FSU,Wouldn't drivers prefer cash tips? Since they're under the table and not taxable.
FSU,In the past I easily got rides for early flights! Not sure if anything has changed in the last few months.
FSU,tbh i’ve always had problems getting ubers early in the morning for the same reason. I recommend calling yellow cab it’s cheaper and much more reliable in my opinion
FSU,I scheduled a 4 am Uber to the airport the day before thanksgiving and it worked fine
FSU,I've had no problems ever getting rides for early flights
FSU,5:45am isn't that early. Plenty of people are going to work around that time so there are generally plenty of Ubers out. I only ever had trouble getting an uber at like 4am.
FSU,the problem with scheduling is they jack the price up ($45 vs. $15 most other times) Nole cab seems cheaper. what day are u flying? my nole will be going to the airport on tue at 5am if y’all want to share a ride
FSU,i’ve had no issues getting an uber at like 3:30am to the airport
FSU,if uber doesn’t work look into getting a cab
FSU,I have always found a ride but the security line can be real long early in the morning. Definitely give yourself some time.
FSU,I’ve mostly had trouble getting Ubers/Lyfts late at night to go home from the airport. Early morning has been fine for me
FSU,"Honestly, Uber is more reliable for early mornings and usually cheaper as well. Lyft is better closer to late morning and afternoons. Otherwise, you can use yellow cab, they charge a flat 20 fee for rides to the airport."
FSU,Call Yellow Cab the day before to set up a ride. Far more reliable than the rideshares. They also have a student discount for pre-scheduled rides. 850-999-9999
FSU,About a month ago we used Uber and messaged for a ride at 4:00am to the airport. Driver was here in ten minutes. Of course as always YMMV.
FSU,"I've never had luck getting a lyft that early, scheduling or no scheduling. It doesn't matter if you schedule if no one shows up."
FSU,I’ve never had issues taking the 4/5 am Lyft to the airport as long as I scheduled it. Usually runs about $25.
FSU,i would suggest scheduling your trip cause then your guaranteed to have someone. Where as if you book at that time it's who ever is available in the area
FSU,They'll show if you pre-schedule pick up.
FSU,I Lyft just lmk what day and I’ll go online
FSU,I've taken cabs at 5:30 in the morning to go places. Uber is pretty reliable and cheaper than Lyft at that hour. 1-2 people might cancel but someone will definitely turn up. Keep an extra 30 minutes in hand.
FSU,Uber/Lyft prices are crazy high and there aren’t many when you look them up. One thing I have learned is that you need a car/carpool to get around. Maybe I’m speaking for myself but the transportation sucks in Tallahassee.
FSU,"Are there even any alternatives any more? Taxis were never huge in this town, but it feels like I've seen even fewer on the roads in recent times."
FSU,"between covid risk, and UI extensions (for drivers who lost their main gigs,) a lot of drivers are just not being incentivized enough to be on the roads right now.

try to preschedule on uber when you can."
FSU,"To me it's less stressful to bring your own car, especially if you wanna get off campus. But if you plan to mostly stay on campus and you're getting the dining plan, then I think you'll be fine, but even then, there is a bus that goes to Publix. To me it really depends on you and if you're used to having your own car and driving around versus taking buses and Uber. But I also would consider how you're going to get home for the breaks if you don't bring own car. You could use Greyhound or rely on your parents or your friends (from your home town) to drive you home. I know a lot of people have bikes/scooters and use those, but no personal experience."
FSU,"like bliss said if youre staying on campus its not necesary. i just moved but staying off campus and find that i wont be using it as much as i thought, but i still will use it often for things like shopping or traveling to places that are farther or later in the evening.

&#x200B;"
FSU,Take the bus. It's free and it goes everywhere important.
FSU,Thanks for the all the advice everyone. I think i'll be taking the bus for a start and start looking for a bike this semester. 
FSU,"Having a moped/motorcycle is an extremely nice thing to have around campus (especially for actually finding parking). However, you have to be super careful as they are prone to be hit by distracted drivers and are easy to steal (definitely get a lock). Good luck!"
FSU,"Could have a car, use bus and Uber for nearby locations. I’d want my car in case I wanted to go to the beach."
FSU,I’ve been here for 3 years now and never realized this was a thing so I wanted to share!
FSU,The amount of money I've wasted...

FSU,Damn I didn't know this. Thank you!
FSU,[removed]
FSU,This is a actually so great thank you!
FSU,"So when in the proper zone, is it best to Lyft instead of snap? Snap instead of Lift?"
FSU,"Its 50% off between those hours but they also give u some free rides! Every year I think I get 5 free rides, it’s so awesome. Sometimes tho it gets really busy and u have to take an uber or wait super long"
FSU,"I’m shocked so many people don’t know about the UF Lyft pass. My friends constantly complain about how expensive Uber is and REFUSE to download Lyft even though I keep telling them about it! 

Anywhere on campus for like a dollar or two. It’s awesome!"
FSU,How does it work? Do we need a code or something?
FSU,"Just a warning to others - I tried to use this last Friday night around 10:30 and Lyft couldn't find a driver (tried twice over 40 mins, just ended up paying full price for an Uber before it got even later) so be sure to have a backup plan!!"
FSU,How do I get this

FSU,Start with OAS and case management. Cast a wide net. Be the squeaky wheel on this so you get what you need.
FSU,"It is possible to get assigned a single room from housing with the medical documentation.  There are apartment style residence halls with single rooms, Ragans Hall and Traditions Hall are entirely of this design.  You would still have to share a bathroom and the kitchen/living room, but you could unmask and relax in your bedroom.  The suite style residence halls do have a few single rooms in them, but those can be hard to get.  If you are sound sensitive you might find it helpful to invest in Loop Earplugs and/or active noise cancelling headphones.  In your classes OAS can arrange for taking tests in a low distraction environment, and it is possible to get extra time on tests as an accommodation.  Note takers can also be an accommodation you can get.  Hope you get your diagnosis paperwork soon from the card center."
FSU,"OAS is down to one Accessibility Specialist at the moment. I would start beginning the process with OAS as soon as possible before the next housing contract opens, if it has not already. The earlier students, as for housing accommodations, the higher the chance housing holds a spot for them. There are limited spots held for students who need accommodations. 

Be very detailed about how a single room will help you out. Explain all the difficulties as well.  And, make sure you get your documentation in as soon as possible. 

They take walk ins pretty much during all their working hours with specific times just dedicated to walks in as well. 

They also do Zoom appointments if you would prefer that or can't make it in person. 

I hope everything works out!

SDSU,"This is why I don’t drive anymore. My second pax ever, not an assist ride, was an elderly man with a broken hip in a wheelchair. I had to fully lift him into my car. His wife promised there would be someone to get him out when we arrived at their care home. There was not. I called support after I lifted him out of my car and got him inside, just to gain some clarity on the liabilities of such a ride. I talked to three people who said they understood what I was asking. A few moments later, I started getting a bunch of emails saying that I need to agree to terms of service. When I got home, I called again and after speaking to five different people, the last one told me there was a note in my file stating I don’t want to help disabled people. I was like, wth, I went above and beyond and did help him. They wouldn’t remove the note and assured me that I still had a five star rating. I said I don’t care about the rating and that was my last day driving."
SDSU,"This was just suggested on my feed-I’m not a driver, nor a customer (we don’t have Lyft in the boonies).

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?  Having that as an option is outrageous. Pizza delivery people probably get paid more for delivering a pizza safely. They want you to transport high risk people with a $4 base pay?  Oooooo boy, no way.  I mean, it’s just laughable how obscene this is."
SDSU,OP you are extremely smart for avoiding a lawsuit. It is a horrible deal. You bring up a lot of extremely valid points. The liabilities are endless for Lyft assisted. Thank you. BTW you are not a disgusting person. You are very smart and know what dangers could happen if something was to occur.
SDSU,Yeah it’s ridiculous how little they offer for these rides. They’re also probably paid for by insurance companies and billed at rates comparable to hospital
SDSU,"They do this in my market without even paying any extra and we have no choice. They come in as regular rides with comments like ""Passenger has Walker and will need assistance with groceries and getting into vehicle"" It's total BS!"
SDSU,"  As a career CABBIE for decades I have helped many elderly and disabled (usually disabled by alcohol, but still...) people in and out of my vehicle. It's just a part of the job. (A job that these gig apps have damned near eliminated ).

   The real issue, OP,  is that the scumbag company you work for is probably charging these ""special needs"" customers a hefty premium for ""special"" service ... and only giving you a tiny slice."
SDSU,"Pretty incredible, really. I feel horrible for the people in their position, but generally they’re transported in ambulances with trained (and well paid) professionals for a reason."
SDSU,God bless them but there should be some sort of government transportation for these type of folks with training. Lyft is pushing their hand. Independent contractors didn’t sign up for that. Even for 20$ I wouldn’t want to do it to be honest.
SDSU,"As a disabled rider, I actually don’t like this. People who try to touch, grab or “help” disabled people without getting permission from the person can be charged with literal assault and I’ve never had a bad experience with a driver that would make me think Assist was necessary or even a good idea. 

I use an ultralight manual wheelchair, and the wheels come off with quick release bolts. If I have someone with me, I get into the car while my companion pops the wheels off and throws the whole thing into the trunk. It’s tiny. If I don’t have help, I can’t do it. 

Here’s the thing though: if someone else touches the chair and something breaks, it voids the warranty. Para transit won’t even do it (and I can’t touch their tie-downs; only the diver can; everyone has to be the only person touching their own equipment.) This happened once. A driver was trying to lock my chair’s brakes and accidentally snapped a brake handle off. I was told I would have to file a police report before the warranty would cover repair (I didn’t even consider doing that I was able to fix it myself; not the end of the world.)

I always send a message to the driver like “hi, can we use your trunk space for a collapsible wheelchair?” And have always been told “yes” or “if it fits” (it always does). I’ve had drivers ask if they can give me help with the chair and I say something like “thanks but no, we need to be the only people putting hands on it so if damage happens, we are the only ones legally responsible. 

Lyft Assist sounds like a terrible idea.  Customer service have told me I should be using that to let the driver know I have a disability.  I’m imagining a driver grabbing me. I have called 911 about strangers touching me without permission. Whatever you may think about how I’m an ingrate who doesn’t understand the kindness of strangers, I’m not the only disabled person I know who has done that. But think about it: if Lyft is telling me I should use Lyft assist, and Lyft is telling drivers they should be physically touching disabled passengers, and medical equipment manufacturers tell you that if someone else touches the chair you MUST file a police report, this really looks like drivers are being set up to take a fall. 

Also, I thought that “give additional tip for using the trunk space” was standard rider etiquette. It’s what people do when they’re using Lyft to get all their groceries home from the supermarket. $4 is about right (2 for trunk space, 2 for the drivers waiting time) and it’s literally not worth that to y’all to take the legal risk. In my state, you need training and  background checks to do chair-to-car transfers. Even handi-van drivers aren’t allowed to. I don’t know what Lyft is thinking putting drivers in that position. If a rider needs a transfer assist, there’s medical transportation and helpers with CNA licenses. Lyft cannot be telling you to literally touch someone."
SDSU,"We don’t have medical transport liability insurance. Rideshare coverage is expensive enough, we aren’t part of a company with that kind of training and insurance backing us. This is a very bad idea. SMDH"
SDSU,"Never heard of this, but thanks for sharing. It's just a total no-go unless you're a rideshare superhero."
SDSU,Yeah. I'm not trying to be a nurse. I'm fine with helping out people here and there if they're having a hard time but dont try to monetize it while fucking me over.  If they want me to be a nurse they can pay me $15 more per trip.
SDSU,That’s a lawsuit with extra steps
SDSU,"I didn’t even realize this was a thing. I think for rides like these maybe there should at least be some training in how to transfer people to/from wheelchairs, some basic medical knowledge, basic dementia training, etc. These type of rides should be marketed to someone who is a CNA or other type of medical professional who maybe wants to supplement their income. Lifting/transferring someone in and out of a car can hurt you (or pax) pretty badly if not done correctly."
SDSU,"There are agencies that work with those with disabilities that are trained and covered to provide these services. Sadly they can't maintain staffing, at least in my region. The agency I get help from with independent living can't find anyone so they get approval to outsource to Uber. It's a nightmare of a resolution for clients, and I feel terrible for drivers. They don't sign up for this, and none seem to know when coming that this is the case. 

&#x200B;

As great as a platform and service it is, it would be nice to keep the medical transportation, non-medical disability related transportation, and uber/lyft as separate platforms and systems. As a consumer of all of these, it's frustrating as of last couple years to have Uber and Lyft being the go-to for everything."
SDSU,"Most of those rides come with a text message as soon as you accept it [please call rider upon arrival wheelchair/leg assistance needed] I cancel immediately, I'm not medical transport.... the last time i did that the ride took 25 minutes for only a 4 mile trip....."
SDSU,"We are not trained for that shit, and the pay is not enough ... #FuckLyft"
SDSU,I get the pov of the drivers but this thread is a rough read if you have a disability.
SDSU,this just smells like a lawsuit waiting to happen
SDSU,"On one hand, Lyft is trying to be an affordable option for those who need it most. On the other hand, para-transport should be cheaper, and widely available."
SDSU,"Not a driver, but I have integrated with the main competitors' version of this as an early customer.

Corporate was literally lying their ass off to the companies that they partner to build demand for this service with. The main competitor actually told my company all these tales about how the drivers get extra training and stricter validation so they can provide what is effectively a medical livery service. No such training happened. More than half the drivers were not aware that the trips were special. It was just an upcharge to the X SUV level in practice.  


Likely Lyft is doing the same thing, but at least they're giving you a measly $4 in kickbacks lol"
SDSU,Doctor here. Agree with OP I’d never in a million years willingly take on that kind of liability.
SDSU,"“Oh so helping ppl is a bad thing now. You sound like a disgusting person” oh pls, stfu. $4 is not enough to deal with the extremities that come with helping the elderly or disabled sometimes. If Lyft really cares, get specialized ppl to do it."
SDSU,"Not to mention that most of these facilities have their own transportation services. We're just cheap labor on call so their drivers earn the same pay but can pass off their cheap patients with cheap insurance to us.

For me, I had a scheduled ride that was great pay from a dialysis center and he was quiet but good dude. The last scheduled ride I got I waited and a doctor came out. I asked for the guy and was told he's in the hospitals hands now.

There hasn't been a schedule ride or even a basic ride that matches that route. It's around the corner for me so it was a convenient ride straight from my own neighborhood.

For me I have alot of regular faces that I get along with as is and I just don't feel like bumming myself out. There are plenty of drivers who will take these anyway for cheap"
SDSU,"Straight up, I can't count how many people I've gone out of my way for the handicap. Hell, even carrying grocies up for them. Not to mention being rude Never not once have these fuckers given me a tip lmao."
SDSU,"Pretty much. I do both Lyft and Uber and people still order UberX for their grandparents that need assistance and here's the thing. I'm 6ft 230lbs I lift weights squat move etc not bragging but Def the son his mom calls to move furniture/shovel snow. And boy howdy do some of these elderly let themselves go I almost threw my back out helping this old guy out not just cuz he was heavy but cuz he decided to fall into me and I caught him and didn't let him collapse onto the cement. My heart jumped.cuz all I thought was ""oh no he died right in my arms"" 
Cuz he had to wake up while I was still awkwardly angled holding him. Oh and his son & daughter whichever one was the in law just gawked at me like ""oh that's papa playing pranks again"" and I look up going ""is he alright"" 
Just ""oh he must have gotten light headed standing"" 
I'm from Chelsea ma I've seen people die from slipping and hitting the curb with their head or neck I've seen people hit by cars going 60 on a 35. I know for a fact I kept this guy alive another day cuz he 100% would be GONE had he hit the sidewalk. They don't even acknowledge what I just did I'm holding passed out 250+lbs of dead weight by the armpits 2 feet from the ground. (No it is nothing like a deadlift ) I didn't want a tip I just wanted to get out of there. My back was messed up for a few days after that and I was panicking to get a weird report from the company that they might report me cuz they seemed the type to get 5star service and still send a report for free shit."
SDSU,Even if we didn't sign up for it Lyft will probably match you when it's busy and no drivers are taking it.
SDSU,Any and all low paying medical rides are an automatic decline/cancel. We don't get paid enough to accept trash can pay in comparison to what Healthcare workers get paid
SDSU,"Honestly, it came in clutch for me when i couldn’t find anyone to take me home from a colonoscopy. It’s the only rideshare option the facility would let me use. I didn’t need any help, just was too drowsy to drive."
SDSU,Never have and never will. We are not medical transport.
SDSU,I am physically disabled and use a wheelchair to get around and I am able to transfer on my own. I thankfully have my own car and drive myself everywhere but the fact that you lump every disabled person together and use such awful ways to describe them makes me glad that I have my own transportation and that I’ve never met you. You seem like a completely disgusting and disrespectful human. Choosing not to sign up for the program is one thing but your post would be discrimination in a typical work environment.
SDSU,"so when a disabled person 'falls on you and breaks their ankle', what you think is how YOUR day is ruined? You're an asshole."
SDSU,"Don’t you get any satisfaction from helping people? You’d probably do this shit for free, as needed, during the course of your normal work."
SDSU,LOL it no difference from the regular pick ups at hospitals. I think the offer is just because they have a high cancel rate.
SDSU,I knew this when they first offered Lyft assisted.  I've had enough problems with blind people getting regular Lyft rides so fuck all that shit.
SDSU,Of course. Standard Lyft and above rides only.
SDSU,"Yeah, fuck people who need help."
SDSU,Also many of those people don’t shower as often as they need to and will be greasy and dirty. Not worth it !
SDSU,If one of them fell in front of me I would laugh
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,How much do they charge the customer for this ?
SDSU,[deleted]
SDSU,In my area we didn’t have to sign up. Some pax have Medicaid and it pays for their trips to the clinic or hospital. We have to help them in and out. Also collapse wheelchairs and walkers and take them out on arrival. I have a list of addresses of clinics I will not drive to on a post it next to my phone
SDSU,I work in an ER and we frequently set up Ubers for patients that the hospital pays for. I don’t know how this works for the drivers but I know I always feel so bad for them for some of the smelly degenerates getting in their car. But at least they have to be ambulatory and alert/oriented for us to be able to do it. This shit sounds like a bad deal.
SDSU,"And 1099 so if something/injury happens , it’s on you dog"
SDSU,"Wow in so many ways!!!!! I work with the elderly and too many things can go wrong. It’s pure greed. They make it seem like a wonderful idea, until the dreaded happens. It’s not a matter of IF, but WHEN."
SDSU,"Def. I had the nicest lady with terminal cancer the other day. Kinda broke my heart but I am not a nurse. I had to move her feet in the car because one of them was swollen and she couldn’t move it. Then she asked if I could take her to her next clinic appointment next week because I made a good impression on her. ATM I said yes, but the I thought about all the implications and how much of a liability it was. The poor lady couldn’t stand or get into her condo. I had to open the door with her keys and grab them out of her purse because they were too heavy for her. Poor thing and sounds bad but it’s not my problem."
SDSU,"fuck no, i ain't volunteer 10 minutes for $4"
SDSU,yeah that seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen tbh
SDSU,I had no idea people were so desperate for money until I came to this sub. It’s really interesting stuff to read.
SDSU,they are probably charging a ton from these elderly customers but only paying a fraction ($4) to the drivers. just another way to leech off of the people who are actually performing services.
SDSU,"Have a little compassion, you'll be old too. I love getting assist. They always tip. $5 + 100% of the time.  Old people somehow love me. Just the other day I picked up an elderly lady opened and closed the door and got her stuff in the car, when I got to her drop off she asked me if I could help her open her door in the garage because it was too heavy for her, gladly did with no sour puss face. Handed me a folded bill, and said thank you. Got in the car opened it up and it was a $20. On top of that her niece tipped $7 off the app, she order her the ride. All of my assist always tip. Yes, it's a little more work, but I don't do it for the money, I have compassion for them. Life's already hard for them, kindness goes a long way."
SDSU,"Had a guy who couldn't get out of the car at all, took 20 minutes, and the neighbor to carry him into his house. The dude shouldn't have been discharged."
SDSU,"Okay so I have a relevant anecdote here. I’m not a Lyft or Uber driver but just a week ago, a car pulled up to my neighbor’s house across the street. Old lady gets out - probably in her 60’s. Has a cane and starts hobbling up the driveway. She’s clearly not my neighbor, but I figure she has business to conduct. She struggles to get up the driveway, taking a good 2 minutes to hobble up about 20 feet. She grabs some plastic bin the neighbor had set out for her and starts the long trek back to the car. Meanwhile the driver can’t be bothered to get out of his car. At this point I’m legitimately worried this lady is going to fall over so I step up and walk over and offer her my arm to lean on so she can get back to the car safely. She proceeds to tell me she had a stroke recently and can’t use the entire left side of her body. She said she tipped the driver extra to get out and grab the bin for her, but he ignored the request. Anyway, she easily could have fallen or worse. So ya, this shit happens. 

The bin was worth about $5 tops secondhand (actually it was a used pet carrier). This lady paid who knows how much to have a driver pick her up, drive her to this house, and pick up a piece of plastic worth less than $5. Not exactly good judgement."
SDSU,I don't think I want to get old. Seems like it's getting worse for elderly people.
SDSU,"I wouldn't sign up for that shit for $400 a ride. For all the liability reasons you listed. Their insurance policy is important the toilet paper it's written on in shit. Damn sure it's never going to cover you while you're helping a little old lady to her door and she falls down and breaks a hip. This is bad as Uber's partnership with go go grandparent. I've never not canceled one of those rides. And I get it, I'm an asshole. But I'll tell you what I'm not. And that's a licensed caregiver. They have ride services for these people with drivers specifically trained and paid to do this kind of work. How many Uber and Lyft drivers are there that know what a DNR is? Or whether or not that person has one on file? I promise you lifting Uber's insurance is not going to cover you if little old granny decides to kill over and you provide life saving CPR and she has a DNR on file. Welcome to liability from hell if you manage to save her life, or in some cases even attempt to. Absolutely no incentives that either of these companies can provide to give these rides is worth it."
SDSU,Rock on!
SDSU,"Actually, I get those rides all the time, and they aren't even marked as assisted.  I also had to help a terminally ill cancer patient into a hospital outside the city that had no cooperation with lyft because his anti-white nurse intentionally sent him to the wrong place... and it wasn't marked as assisted.  It took more than an hour onsite to coordinate between the clinics rather than to abandon a poor terminally ill man outside the wrong clinic.  Lyft gave me like an extra 2 dollars because of the time spent."
SDSU,How do u opt out of it?
SDSU,Stop protesting and start turning down every shitty ride offer.  Everyone has to do this.
SDSU,"Needs to be in San Fran not San Diego but still it’s more than we had a few days ago.  Need a riot in front of all app Headquarters.  

They screw you, they screw institutional investors, they feel entitled, they break your hearts, go break something of theirs"
SDSU,Good for them! Drivers should be united together
SDSU,I propose we make a free app on android and ios that allows for uber and lyft drivers to organize and strategize in every city. Sponsorships for the app could include university ads and fitness ads. Healthy stuff ;) Whoever has programming knowledge could help. The App will help connect less tech savvy drivers with this beautiful movement toward fair wages..
SDSU,Love to see it!!
SDSU,Lyft rips drivers off and they still don’t make a dime in profit.
SDSU,Love it. We should all do this
SDSU,Lyft riders or drivers?
SDSU,Man I could've swear that someone in this group was bragging about making $35 an hour in San diego.
SDSU,Silly drivers…. So many easier ways to make a living
SDSU,"The real answer is simple, every ride we see what we pay Lyft and what rider pays us.

Allegedly we pay them instead of them paying us, so to make everything perfect, we should see what rider pays every request and see what we are offered overt request.

Would fix 99% of problems because drivers would know when to refuse.

Other 1% is they have to fix destination changes. Rider needs to be told that they will pay the same even if they choose a shorter location afterwards. Price should never go lower unless the driver authorizes it. 

Also, bad ratings should be negated when rider changes to a shorter trip to avoid shenanigans."
SDSU,I had no idea. Might be why I was so busy today.
SDSU,lol
SDSU,"Yeah, protest. That’s the answer alright. 

With the time you wasted at the protest you coulda started up your own LLC, launched a quick website, and designed some business cards. Instead for some reason you think these companies are just gonna start paying you a livable wage even though time after time, month after month, and year after year it’s been proven otherwise."
SDSU,They would need to burn down a Lyft hub in order to really get them to give a rat's ass about us
SDSU,Rideshare was never intended and cannot be your main hustle/job. But do your thang more power 🙏🏾
SDSU,Labor doesn't contribute to profits lol.
SDSU,"Is it a socialism ?!?! Protesting. 

Go to Dubai, protest there."
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,"If all drivers actually united, ants included, we would all be living a lot better."
SDSU,Fck lyft
SDSU,Whst is pax?
SDSU,"Oh fuck yea, can we do this at SFO too? If we block the entrance to garages no one can get in to do pickups. But airport security will probably have something to say about it lol. 

Maybe letting people in once the surge reaches +$20 would be ok. Show that we are willing to work at appropriate rates, and we have the power to create artificial surges."
SDSU,"Gentlemen,

You would make more working at McDonald’s."
SDSU,Thanks 😊
SDSU,"Yea, like that's going work. Lyft doesn't care. That's the biggest roadblock, indifference."
SDSU,San Diego showing some big balls
SDSU,Power to the workers
SDSU,"This needs to happen more often, in more places!"
SDSU,"I think both Lyft and Uber are way overdue for a full fledged stay off the app strike until they start paying us a decent amount for making them millions on a daily basis. They're using and ripping us off. We're paying all maintenance, fuel, insurance... everything while they're making all the money. Change will not happen until us drivers force them. LET'S STRIKE LYFT AND UBER FOR BETTER PAY AND REAL SUPPORT."
SDSU,"My condolences. Sending thoughts and prayers on behalf of Lyft because we all know their support system is garbage, and they have not a dime to spare for those that cover the low volume times."
SDSU,Come to Orlando and we will show you the unhappiest place on Earth right now.
SDSU,"This is better than in Northern CA. Lyft offers nothing but shit $4, $5, and $6 dollar rides. Anything over $10 either has multiple stops or covers a long distance paying 50c a mile. Lyft is fuckin worthless if there are no streak bonuses. Speaking of which, haven't seen a streak bonus or ride challenge in close to 2 months. I basically treat Lyft like a destination filter"
SDSU,What area are you in and how many rides did you decline?
SDSU,And here I thought they paid more in the winter.
SDSU,"Dave drove for an hour between 430 - 530 because there was a surge for the after work crowd! Dave was planning to stay out until 8, but at 530 the rides started to slow down and offers became unacceptably low, so Dave went home after having made $28 in an hour! Dave doesn’t drive if the money isn’t there! 

Be like Dave!"
SDSU,11hrs and only 9 rides = 119$ WTH did you do with all that time?
SDSU,"Time to get a big boy/girl job and work for the man! Everyone wants ""job freedom"". So everyone works for gig apps and the pay goes lower and lower. Supply and demand. 2024 will be even worse. Idiots will end up paying to drive for Uber/Lyft, im convinced of it."
SDSU,Omg this is sickening!!
SDSU,I would say they a different app if it's that bad in your market. For sure run both lyft and uber. At least you got some tips sprinkled in there. I'm constantly checking both app and just do what ever one is better. In my area at least I .take more on uber but lyft gives me better streak bonus. For reference I have about 15k rides on uber and 4k on lyft. Over about 7 years
SDSU,Hang in friend there’s always January buckle up
SDSU,Wow I made this in 2 and 1/2 hours yesterday morning doing Uber
SDSU,"It’s drivers like you that make drivers like me $75/hr. 

Lyft takes 50% of your fares because you drive when there’s no demand
Lyft gives me a surge that is equal to that 50% they took from you because I only drive when there is demand

But go ahead … keep grossin’ $12/hr why slowly destroying your body. 

It’s not a job. It’s barely a gig. Stop trying to make it one."
SDSU,I can make $300 in 12 hours with Uber in DFW daily. You gotta use Lyft to supplement for Uber. It's mostly crap.
SDSU,"That’s over $10 per ride, nice job you earned it. Pay some bills and buy something nice or take yourself out to dinner."
SDSU,You made $120.....you make it seem like you earned just $5.00!! Too many entitled drivers....get humbled.
SDSU,The other app will welcome you with open arms.  BTW need to scroll through the app before you start each day.  Make sure all streaks and bonuses are available
SDSU,It gets worse here in Ohio yesterday in Columbus. I’ve made close to $200 in 9 hours wtf I’m already looking for a job fuck Lyft
SDSU,Thats crazy
SDSU,Zoinks 😬
SDSU,Same here in LA the last week or so. Barely anything and it’s just too damn sad
SDSU,"In DC they removed the graphic chart showing busy times bc likely too many complained it wasn’t accurate.  I USED that every weekend to decide when to drive peak. One by one I have decreased hours on Lyft bc I can’t reach a human, pay falls, bonuses have evaporated, and here lately tips are higher on Uber."
SDSU,Only problem is— Dave cannot afford to Live In America anymore because he doesn’t have three jobs. That’s why Dave is doing Ride share when the robots navigating his life to chase the money.
SDSU,First time?
SDSU,9 rides in 11 Hours and 53mins that math is not adding up
SDSU,You only made $900 or barely $1000 this stuff is so trash now
SDSU,11 hours I’m lissed for you man
SDSU,what kind of car do you have? just curious. i’m in the bay area (mainly SF) and if i put in those hours i’m getting no less then $300-550. I do a lot of airport rides though.
SDSU,"Keep it going. Let's say you waste 5 seconds each time you receive a shitty request like 10 mile drive 1 dollar 79 cents (pick-up bonus included) and it shows the same ride to a 30 different driver in the area. That is 2 minutes 30 seconds of extra waiting time for rider to find a ride, that could have been avoided if they stopped being the greedy assholes they are."
SDSU,"Lyft knows me, you better throw a $15 or more streak at me if you want me accepting ever ride!"
SDSU,"I doubt the veracity of their claim regarding ""typical drivers"".  It would be even less effective for them to say, *""Hey, we know most drivers rejects these garbage rides, but can you do us a solid and help out?""*"
SDSU,sub 30% acceptance rate gang
SDSU,"""Try to be our slave."""
SDSU,"Work for yourself Be Your Own Boss, also accept every ride or will kick you off the platform."
SDSU,Don’t give us upfront fare details and then chastise us for actually using it !!
SDSU,I marked it as spam never had another one since lol
SDSU,"Lyft is NOT a community. It’s a for profit, publicly traded POS corporation that rips independent contractors off."
SDSU,I talked to two drivers tonight and they aren't phased. Goobers taking every ride. Mafffs shoulda been taught in grade school.
SDSU,I got this two days ago so we are non typical bros now
SDSU,Sometimes I run the app just to data mine statistics
SDSU,Just means you’re making more money than the other drivers in your area. Can’t conceive any situation where acceptance rate for Lyft or uber should be above 20 percent nowadays.
SDSU,My acceptance rate has dropped by 26 point and declining fast. Cancellation from zero to 4% and from platinum to silver and soon to be rust…
SDSU,28% right now. I might turn the app on & bring it down even lower maybe that’s where the fair priced rides are? 😂
SDSU,Is typical my new trigger word ?
SDSU,im at 99% acceptance
SDSU,Just ignore it. I had 100% acceptance rate and declined a ride once because I was trying to log off when I got the request and didn't want to do a 20-minute trip I wanted to go home. So I declined that trip and I immediately got that message.
SDSU,I got a saucy email about waiting it the timer ⏱ of all things 🥴. I responded to the wind about not how running out the timer is a safety feature. Lyft has the dumbest takes with their emails and a shit attitude with its drivers. The app is trash.
SDSU,"Depends, in FL you need to be 26 or older, a 3 year driving record with less than like 3 or something points on your license.

Try doordash instead."
SDSU,Have you just never once put the effort in to go to their websites?? Or apply common sense?
SDSU,"Depending on your area, driving for a couple hours each day riding streaks can gross you a good ~1000-1500 a month with minimal work, but lyft will lower your streak rate regularly if you ride those times too much; Uber requirements are a bit stricter with drivers than lyft."
SDSU,"Multi app because each app has different rates at the same time and that’s what the customers are doing to get the lowest price. Some days it’s non stop on Uber and dead on Lyft and visa Versa. Keep detailed receipts on everything for taxes such as mileage, car wash pass, etc"
SDSU,Do both
SDSU,I’ve been stuck in this Lyft rental program for a month slaving away and it helped me out because I was out of a car but they pay you less when using the rental. I struggled to make the payment. I’m just now getting out of it
SDSU,"Rental programs are a joke and predatory, nothing new

Most markets you want the ability to use Uber and Lyft, but with rentals, you can't."
SDSU,"I really don't understand how it would be a surprise?  If you get a company vehicle, you have to be generating enough revenue to pay for the car AND yourself no matter what.."
SDSU,"I asked about this yesterday but IMO the only viable reason to rent a car is if your car is in the shop needing repairs or as in my case, I was thinking of doing it just to test the waters of doing Lyft/Uber type driving but don’t currently have a qualifying vehicle to do it. Mainly in order to see if I like doing it and test the waters of my area before buying a used car."
SDSU,"Just sharing my two cents here with the Lyft express drive: i just got out of it today, it was a month and a half of mixed feelings with the car. I got better tips and i worked pretty much every day for 10 hours. Yes, gas took away a good chunk but I got enough to pay my bills and stay afloat while looking for another car and another job. I got those last week. For me it worked out okay but the fees are ridiculously high and gas prices are no help either. Ponder your options if you are out of a car and need one. But you really gotta get out of it quickly and get a steady income besides Lyft."
SDSU,"Per mile and per minute rate is less with a rental then it is normally! Do not rent from Lyft , modern day slavery"
SDSU,"Hey that's crazy I LITERALLY been waiting for one of these posts to pop up for like 2 weeks now , so I was driving for Lyft for a month I was homeless my older cousin helped me get the deposit and helped me get a bank account , I had a electric car a kira Niro Ev 2023 the first few weeks was cool and chill I wasn't really bothered by nobody for perspective (I'm black 25 with 1 daughter in my life a newborn to be exact) so you can imagine nothing really bothers me from arguing amongst riders people eating in the car people tryna flirt with you ( both female and male) 
It wasn't till maybe the month mark I started noticing little things like for one my weekly rental fee supposed to be 330 nothing higher or more that's with the insurance and fees they said man I noticed I been getting 487 weekly rental charges weekly and then I noticed the toll of driving all day and night then driving back home  I would drive in Sacramento all over to the valley and Santa Cruz but nobody told me that for one that there's no evcs chargers down the central valley area as far as level 3 and up be lucky there's a level 2 around , then the slow days I gotten so many slow days in the valley I never drove in Stockton for the reason of a bad experience of almost getting shot during a ride , like I literally had to either sleep in the car for the weekdays to actually have energy to drive to Sacramento  then drive back home , I wasn't eating cause I wouldn't make enough money it was just so many variables and Lyft was just no help at all I was a pure t star driver not one single low review or none of that platinum driver and what Lyft do leave out vital information I learned to only drive for Lyft and Uber with your own car or have a job on top before even driving Lyft cause those fees are ridiculous but on the bright side of you get in a accident in they car you can always get you a new one as long as it wasn't your fault"
SDSU,"I rent a car and pocket about 800-1000 after rental fee and gas per week driving 6 days 8-10 hours. I live in a big city. Personally this is enough to live on and save quite a bit too. The money is there if you put the time in, but the hours could bother some people. Lyft barely feels like work to me so I'm able to easily grind the 50-60 hours per week without burnout."
SDSU,Renting a car is for those in a dire situation or suckers.
SDSU,"I crashed their shit car, didn't even pay the 500 deductible, still let me drive for them in the new whip before completely quiting shit exploitative ride share gigs"
SDSU,It's indentured servitude
SDSU,"Got a rental as my car was hit by a DD while I slept. 

My area flexdrive just bought a ton of hybrids 2023. I got one. Had 7 miles on it when I picked it up. I get about 50 mpg and fill up every 2 days of driving vs everyday in my personal vehicle. 

It is 300 a week towards the rental and fees but I am going to get reimbursed on that from either my insurance or the DDs insurance. (DD insurance is trying to claim the driver was not insured.)

But yeah the rates are lower. But the gas is much better. 30 bucks every 2 days. 

You have to put on miles for it to be worth it."
SDSU,Rented for a year loved and hated it never had a problem until my car broke down. Hertz billed me for the world and claims I still owe $150 today. They don’t care about anyone lyft nor hertz will help me. So I’m done with the both of them forever…
SDSU,I drove my own vehicle- a 2020 Chevy Traverse for a couple months last year for Uber and Lyft. An 8-passenger car supposedly gets the premium rate per trip. I was shocked at the low payouts I was getting daily versus the mileage and wear on my vehicle so I quit. Turns out the Detroit (mine) and San Francisco markets have the 2 lowest payout rates in the nation. Fucking ripoff.
SDSU,Renting is easy for me because I can actually make $300 a day but only on Mondays....For some reason it's more profitable. I don't have to worry about maintenance..All I have to do is put gas and keep it clean...You have to grind I'm already into making my money. Plus I drive a M7 series Beamer I can protect my investment by keeping my mileage down... To each its own....I still can make at least about $1k a week....What y'all doing? I know Lyft plays games but I only do rides that makes sense time wise and money wise....Maybe not look for big long trips...I take short to somewhat medium rides
SDSU,"Lyft, Uber or whoever the fuck else is in business for one reason to make a profit.  They don't give a fat babies ass except for their bottom line.  The fact that these COCKSUCKERS can get away with taking almost 2/3rds of the fare is outrageous.  It wasn't like that when it started but now that so many people are out of work the gig economy is overflowing with people which allows them to fuck all of us with a soft dick.  This is the way of the world. They also know that the majority of the people who drive for them don't have the necessary degrees to do anything better.  Now degrees don't equate to intelligence it's nothing more than a passport to get your foot in the building with still no guarantee for a job.  It also doesn't help that this country is a corporation run by corporations.  For instance look what happened recently in Illinois(correct me if I'm wrong), where the Governor who was clearly bought By Uber vetoed a bill that would made drivers employee's and not contractors. If this would have passed it would have created a snowball affect to other states and cities. So don't ever expect a company like Uber who made a net profit of over 14 billion to give a fuck about us...14 billion dollars and all they are is nothing more than a match making app for car services."
SDSU,"It’s not for everyone or every market. I managed to pay my 260 every weekend in two days over the span of 6 hrs each day. The rest of the week was gravy. I could do more rides or a regular job/side hustle. $10 of gas got me $200 in rides or other. You think your own car will be any better? Let’s say $500 for your car payment…$200 for your insurance. Gas…. Then incidentals like new tires…. Maintenance… it’s the same shit just how you pay for it. You pay 1000 a month but don’t have to also save half of your income incase shit happens to your car. Tires all four will be $800 upfront. With the rental you pay for the rental that week not $800. There are pros and cons and If you hustle it’s doable if you don’t like hustling and choosing what days you do what and when…then yes the rental is not for you. Your market can suck also making the rental a bad move too, but it also isn’t a bad move for everyone. 

It’s not for you if you have a car with a car payment. 
It’s not for you if your market sucks ass
It’s not for you if you can afford and are capable of getting a car financed. 
It’s not for you if you aren’t structured in your work."
SDSU,For me personally I rent because my car went up and insurance refused to cover full cost. Took the insurance money and got the rental. I make my rental payment in about 14 hours of work and leaves me 5 days of profit. I’m in the Las Vegas market so it’s constantly busy but can’t speak for anywhere else.
SDSU,This mf has never seen a period in their life.
SDSU,[deleted]
SDSU,"Totally not worth it, high rental fees and low payouts."
SDSU,Not even an option in the Detroit metro.
SDSU,Water is wet....
SDSU,Big scam i grinded a month upgraded to Tesla rental to save on gas i was doing $80 gas daily driving 12hrs online time. if you don’t plan to drive 7 days a week 9-12 hrs you will find yourself in a big financial hole also with hertz rental thru Uber. Thankfully i stopped. Did school full time got nice financial aid check nd put that down on a 2021 Prius prime now I’m back driving lyft nd It’s worth it.
SDSU,"I can only imagine how rough it is. I don't rent a car from them and find the money not worth it. I tried driving to make a little extra bill money. The app crashes my phone and when it does work, the trips are just not worth it regardless of the time of day."
SDSU,Reminds me of predatory yellow cab practices. Except those drivers were forced to borrow up to $100K and basically be enslaved for decades to pay it off. At least you can get out of this one in a month.
SDSU,"Not to mention they cut your per mile and per minute in nearly 50% on top of the cost of the rental, they give you tons of streaks in the beginning and then poof no more leaving you to literally die out there!"
SDSU,"I mean, what did you really think?"
SDSU,Also don't do it unless you are ready for them to pull the plug without warning and kill the program in your area.
SDSU,"And yet people still think renting a car is a GOOD idea. There are even more than rent Teslas thinking they are going to make big bank, but are in for a big surprise when they are working their tails off just to make the rental payment."
SDSU,AGREED!  I’m in the hole with Lyft due to the ridiculous electric car rental they offered.  I was given rides as low as $2.30 and hardly ever received anything over $10….you literally work 24/7 and pay them an astronomical amount for the rental AND you are required to meet their minimum amount of drives also for the week.  Your literally working for them to increase their earnings and we get screwed!!
SDSU,i do not understand why anyone would choose this model unless lyft was their full-time job though. i make 400 a day but thats only with this as my main. i can’t survive with this as a side hustle
SDSU,"The rental program is really for full times drivers who average about 100-135 trips a week and make at least 1000-1500 a week.

Only way u can win otherwise is if you have other main sources of income. And u use Lyft to avoid putting miles on your car"
SDSU,"A heard about ""Ryde""  a decentralized  driver owned network, I hope they launch soon https://ryde.tech/"
SDSU,Its like 8.50 an hour
SDSU,It’s modern indentured servitude. I had to bust my ass just so I’d have a car to get to work. I made them so much money and never broke even and had to pay to work for them for months. I would drives for hours a day and it still wouldn’t even end up being $50.
SDSU,"I'm renting the Tesla right now, mainly to test drive it before buying one lol."
SDSU,Capitalism at its finest
SDSU,"It’s almost as if everyone’s experience is different…

Just because it doesn’t work for you doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for everyone."
SDSU,"And yet, I was still able to work hard and save for 3 years and buy a brand new Honda CRV. 

Hard work, yes.  Nothing worthwhile is easy, or everybody would do it.

It is STILL an opportunity."
SDSU,"They overcharged me, they have a lawsuit coming. A big one"
SDSU,Idk what ur doin wrong but I only drive 4-5 days a week and make 1000+ after expenses 😋
SDSU,"Unfortunately Lyft and Uber have become modern day slavery, with no real intervention from the law they are literally paying about $7-8 per hour once you factor ALL the expenses plus taxes, McDonalds its a better option at this point  with the way they’re flat out taking 80% of what customers pay is just doesn’t make sense to do it at all"
SDSU,"They can be useful in emergencies when you just gotta keep that income stream steady. Learn how to be a more efficient endentured servant to their system and you'll pull more cash. The way I see it, sometimes the vehicle usage and even a $40 come up out of a whole week is better than $0 cuz you sat in ur ass at the crib eating cheetos and masturbating at your parents house because honestly you can do that in the car too on ur way to pick up passengers.  At that point ur like 3-5 birds with maybe 2 stones"
SDSU,If anyone rents from left they are really stupid.   Look. If you don’t have a car then rideshare isn’t for you.   People are stupid
SDSU,Just went through this. It was easy. Everything was deductible. I owed $2 nd the filing fee for the $11k i generated in 3 months. 9k income. Worked rideshare for those 3 month yes. $2 dollars.
SDSU,Stop spreading false info and stop being lazy
SDSU,You realize you can get the money back at the end of the year in tax returns for miles/rentals/depreciation on vehicles if it’s due to business and you’re a 1099 contract worker right?
SDSU,Guess you have issue for the weekly cost for rental? Lol
SDSU,Just keep on slaving until you can pay the minimum down payment for your own car. Then you won't be renting from Lyft and you'll get away from Lyft slavery and join in Grub hub Uber and other Slave apps.🥰 Keep stacking up and use the saving option in the Lyft Direct app of need be.
SDSU,"I used the car rental to get a job, lol. I just drove on weekends to pay the fee. But back then it was cheaper."
SDSU,I’m going to be that guy. Duh.
SDSU,I’ve been doing it for over a year. I have my reasons but honestly I make enough driving Uber and playing poker to cover the fee every week. They recently started requiring 20 rides per week which I’ll do when they offer a bonus and it cuts down the rental fee a bit.
SDSU,Why in God's name would you think that would be a good business decision? Some of you all need to go work for someone because you obviously can't work for yourselves
SDSU,It's all part of the Lyft experience. Embrace the suck!   Lol
SDSU,Now we understand upfront pay…it’s a way for them to screw renters from rate cards.
SDSU,You are also forgetting the most important thing is taxes are going to be a bitch for you because you are a 1099 independent contractor
SDSU,A program like Flexdrive or an approved private rental company sucks less if you get the unlimited mileage...at least then you can multi-app (which is what I did before I finally bought).
SDSU,I just drive enough to keep it for my personal use.
SDSU,Why not rent a car from somewhere else? Im not a lyft driver jw
SDSU,"I drive a rental and just started with Lyft. I stay outside Chicago, but went downtown and around lakeshore area. I’ve already made, more than my rental, within 3 days…maybe just focus on, making the rental first and then, do more rides, so you can have more money yourself. You signed up for the rental and knew, what came with it. I’d rather pay for a rental, than have all that damage/wear and tear, on my vehicle. Nothing wrong with, renting a car through Lyft"
SDSU,A bike and door dash no o fee no gas
SDSU,Well duh? They arent just gonna rent you a car to do what you want... They rent you a car so you work their platform... What you thought you could just have your own car for cheap?
SDSU,I was just talking to driver the other day and mentioned I might try driving with the Lyft and she mentioned this program. Definitely glad I read this post before signing up.
SDSU,"Do it if there's a bonus involved to play for it. However, the rate card is 30-40,% compared to the rate card of an individual who drives their personal vehicle"
SDSU,All facts. I practically lived in my rental with Lyft. Ugh. But I ended up buying my own car.
SDSU,Facts
SDSU,Do you fools not read a contract or know how to use a calculator before signing them? SMH...
SDSU,Well yeah that’s driving
SDSU,Indenture service
SDSU,"Same goes if you buy your own car. The mileage and wear on the car goes before you even pay the car off. 

I agree with everything you say...except get your own car."
SDSU,I pay $250 per week for my rental
SDSU,To be fair I don’t understand why you want to rant about something you should have already known
SDSU,Lit any newcomers b4 u get into this program i strongly advise u have money put aside for the car itself and gas.  And your goal should be 150-170 a day that way u can put gas and stash a few bucks everyday
SDSU,"Well, if you can’t do the basic math of it’s gonna cost you X number of dollars before you make any money than you deserve to be broke either way. But it’s in your area. It makes sense to do it rather than not do it then you should go ahead and do whatever you want."
SDSU,When I used to do the rental program is 2019 it was 297 a week …how much is it now?
SDSU,Y’all are not using it correctly
SDSU,"I remember renting a few years back, they did note that people who rent with their express program do get paid less from their fares. And then a few months later they would even pay the express rental drivers even less when they updated the pricing.
This was when their cars was 274 a week. Excluding the 200 deposit."
SDSU,"Guys you have to put in the numbers different to see the whole figure in the end. 
The Lyft rental is now: 
$280      A WEEK
$1120     A MONTH
$13,340 A YEAR

Now think about…you buy for example a new Toyota Corolla Hybrid. On the Toyota Homepage this car cost you: 

Fair credit score of 650
Down $2000
48 Months finance 
———————————
Total: $605/ Month

So let’s compare:

                        Finance             Lyft Rental
Month             $605                 $1,120
Year                $7,260               $13,340
48 Months     $29,040            $53,340
Savings          $24,300            $0
Car sale          $10,000            $0
————————————————————-
Bank savings 
account after 
48mo            + $34,300         + $0"
SDSU,"hertz gave me a broken car I couldn’t use to work, and when I tried to return it they said I was 3 minutes late and charged me $180 for the whole weekend and Friday.

I actually quit over this, never had a temp agency steal from me or make me work for free"
SDSU,I’m glad I read this. I just canceled my rental reservation for the express drive. Seems like exploitation to me.
SDSU,"Yeah currently in this situation, 361 a week for the rental. Plus gas. But I need a car, and they make so much off you doing this! They even pay less per ride when you have one of the hertz vehicles!"
SDSU,What happens if I’m missing like 5 dollars for the weekly rental
SDSU,[deleted]
SDSU,I'm sorry mate :/ I live in San Diego myself and I see so many Uber / Lyft cars. Probably because there is an overflux of drivers. 
SDSU,"Barely $4 for driving 2 people, wow what kind of rates does San Diego have! man this is becoming ridiculous.  They should just increase prices and just end primetime or surge, that way drivers can make constant good money, and passengers won't be closing app when they see Primetime notification!"
SDSU,Spend some time figuring out where the best area to Drive is in your Area. I frequently get caught trying to make Orange Juice out of Lemon's and if I just stuck to where it was profitable and the times it was profitable I would do much better. 
SDSU,I cut off driving Lyft after 9AM at that point all the drivers are out and the app goes haywire.  It doesn’t matter how critical the need the algorithm doesn’t schedule trips fairly for all. That is why you have to keep moving which exhausts resources. It’s like they forgot to program the app to keep re pinging your location to the server. If you look at your battery usage you’ll see that Uber uses 3 to 4 Times more resources than what Lyft does that because Uber’s app never stops refreshing. Until Lyft admits the driver app as faulty were all going to be hurting. There’s 70 000 people in my city right now for a RV Heavy Equipment Expo Uber surging to 4.0 X and all I got in 4 hours on Lyft was $8 for 1 Ride. No one can tell me that’s due to low demand something is wrong with that app
SDSU,How far did you go?  Was it traffic that took that long?
SDSU,"$1,500 / 200 = $7.5
Take every single ride that pays less than $7.50"
SDSU,for 200 rides.... dang thats a lot for nothing
SDSU,"The older drivers pay the new drivers by being throttled so the new drivers get that lovely guarantee .

At what point to you realize they have always controlled what you make per ride ! Lol"
SDSU,"They’re guaranteeing you $1500 but if you make more the deal is off the table but if you make
$1,000 doing  200 rides they’ll give you the extra $500"
SDSU,Sketchy job anyways. I’m good off that. Food is way better to delivery and safer. Weird ass people in my car.
SDSU,When I started last august it was 1000 for 5 rides I haven’t been on in about almost three weeks waiting  for another incentive  to drive for them I’ve been doing mostly Uber the last few weeks and doing ok
SDSU,Yup when I started was $2k but yes it’s guaranteed so they only pay the difference
SDSU,"Which is why I’m not doing a lot in my hometown during summer bc the summer drivers are being fed all the good work (made $200 a day just doing Uber my first week, not since by staying in town)"
SDSU,It’s a guarantee not a bonus.
SDSU,go to busy area that needs short rides.  Like bar area or college area.  Just do the $3/ 10 minute or less rides.
SDSU,"Pure garbage.  They know that $1500 on 200 rides will leave them owing you pennies.  Accepting only $3-4 rides is an option.  However, at that point, the guarantee is more of a rebate on lost time than actual profit."
SDSU,Oh...I see you caught on to Lyft word play. Yeah the guarantee bonuses are 🐂💩
SDSU,Meanwhile doordashing paying me $3000 for 270 orders
SDSU,I can make 3500 in 200 rides wtf
SDSU,"Oh wow that sucks lol. It was $1400 guaranteed for 100 rides when I did it 2 years ago, ended up getting just over $600 after completing it."
SDSU,[deleted]
SDSU,That's a real shitty one. 200 rides? You will probably surpass that 1500  around 100 or so rides
SDSU,"1500? Wow they lowered it. It was 3000 when I started 8 months ago. My advice is to take all rides. The lower the fare, the better the payout. 10 rides usually averages around 100 bucks for me in Phoenix. If you were at that rate here, you wouldn’t get that guarantee"
SDSU,You ONLY take short rides. Reject everything else.
SDSU,"Yeah, as guarantees go, that ones crap. I don’t even know that I’d bother. Look for the ones that are$15/ ride or more (depends on market, obv)."
SDSU,Guarantee vs bonus. 2 different concepts for Lyft.
SDSU,You might get more money even before you get to that many trips
SDSU,You might get more money even before you get to that many trips
SDSU,I’m not logging on until they send me one of these lol. Only thing I ever see is like a streak at 4am. No thanks.
SDSU,Alot of people are missing that it doesn't include tips. It's a good deal and you will make good money. Take as many short trips as you can.
SDSU,"That’s 7.50 per ride so take only short rides to make up for it. After Covid Lyft lowered their pay per mile, be smart not stupid."
SDSU,Take every short ride you can get.  Filter your rides thru a 5 mile radius or use the arrive on time filter and keep it within a half hour of your home by keeping the time within 30 minutes.
SDSU,"Yeah, mine was $200 for 3 rides. As a bonus though. Did 3 short rides the first day."
SDSU,This is how guarantees have always worked.
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,"I got this offer, took every short and fast ride possible

Lyft has a radius filter to keep you in a certain area. 

Depending where you live, do it in a city center. 

I completed this in about 5 days and made about $600 got paid $900 from Lyft."
SDSU,That's 100 hours right there in my market.
SDSU,$1500 for 200 rides is a scam it should be more like $4000 for 200 rides
SDSU,WELCOME TO LYFTONOMICS🤣
SDSU,"Run both apps, assuming you do uber too and cherry pick both apps. Ubers hot? Keep going on uber till you get a lfyt short. And back and forth. You'll knock it out and make money and stay busy"
SDSU,And if you make more - they will shadow ban you from good rides
SDSU,Work: for money. GUARANTEED
SDSU,It's always the difference.  The big print says earn 1500.  In fine print it says that they'll pay the difference and that you'll earn at least 1500
SDSU,I once got an offer from Uber for $3200 guaranteed  for 270 rides did all the short rides pulled it off in 6 days
SDSU,Cherry pick the rides with short pick ups and short rides. You’ll only get paid $3-$4 each but they can be done quickly and Lyft will owe you a lot of money when you’re done.
SDSU,Why would you think it was a bonus? They make it VERY clear. They even added an example for those that had a difficulty understanding what a guaranty is.
SDSU,So give 200 rides to strangers and earn the same amount as someone on unemployment? Huge L
SDSU,So if you do 200 rides you get 1500$ plus the money you make for the 200 rides
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,I’ll never understand how so many don’t understand what a guarantee is.
SDSU,It is $1500. Not sure why you think $1500 is not $1500.
SDSU,Man this one is cake. All 3-5 dollar rides. I’d be done in two weeks if I had this one.
SDSU,"You’ll easily get $1,500 with 200 trips and Lyft won’t give you anything sadly."
SDSU,Oh wow 7.5$ per ride! What a deal!!
SDSU,I just cherry picked the fastest rides when I get these
SDSU,[removed]
SDSU,"Can you read what it says? 

It says they can guarantee you will make at least $1500 in those 200 rides. If you are under that for some reason then they will make sure you make $1500.

Nowhere did it say you get an additional $1500 for completing 200 rides,"
SDSU,Bro it literally says earnings guarantee. Just because you don't understand what that means doesn't mean much
SDSU,And the algo will purposefully give you all the long rides in the area. It a real trap.
SDSU,"It clearly states they will pay you ""the difference"" on eligible earnings $1500-$x(even showed a scenario). Clearly, you didn't even do the most basic thing, read the terms."
SDSU,There IS a Lyft drivers sub...
SDSU,Wow! 200 rides. They’re smoking something good at LYFT hahaha back in the good old days that’s woulda been 120 rides for $1500 guarantee.
SDSU,"The whole ""it's for part time only"" is nothing more than a corporate technique for justifying low pay.

The reality is doing it part time does not magically make the pay better or more ethical.  The only thing part time might do for you is enable you  to be more picky about the rides you take and/or the hours you work-- if you have availability in your schedule.

In fact, if I have another full time job and my bills are paid, why would I ever get off my couch to go pick someone up at Walmart with a cart full of groceries for $3.75?  The idea of it is ridiculous in fact.  Who would ever do that?

The truth is though, the full timers are the ones who make the system work.  And full timers absolutely deserve a living wage.  Especially since our vehicles (""investment"") are often $20,000+."
SDSU,Preach man preach🏆
SDSU,"Yeah I’m gonna have to look for something else. This shit is a joke, once you tally up the expenses and wear and tear on your vehicle it’s a money pit and the Lyft ceos are laughing their way to the bank."
SDSU,"Fuck them all
If I have a gun with 6 bullets in a room with Ben laden, Hitler, and both companies CEOs, I’ll shoot the last two 3 times each 🫡"
SDSU,"Relying on Lyft as it’s a full time job is bad, but using it an addition with a full time job makes life pretty manageable with how expensive things are. Do Lyft/uber on a Saturday for 4-6 hours and you can easily make 300-500$, that’s my car payment for the month

People fucked up relying solely on rideshare for all their income"
SDSU,I’m not upset at all. If anything I’m really happy for you. Your decision to find a job other than do this is definitely a good decision for just about anyone. Both Uber and Lyft suck ass and treat both their drivers as well as passengers like shit. I wouldn’t be surprised if they treat their internal employees just as badly.
SDSU,"I've been driving for Uber for 6 years. I signed up for Lyft in Jan 2020, but only have about 700 rides total with them (13,250 rides with Uber) 

I have only ever done rideshare as a side gig. As I've progressed at my day job, I've driven less and less. Now I'm almost strictly weekends. When I started rideshare, my hours at my day job were not very consistent. I might work just a few days a week for 15 hours, or I could work 6 days in a row with 50+ hours. I would use rideshare to supplement the days I didn't work. It's also cyclical work where the cycles are opposing to rideshare. When one is busy, the other isn't. So this complimented my day job pretty well. 

I couldn't imagine if I had to rely on this for my sole income."
SDSU,"I already applied to UPS and am starting this week and am applying to other jobs. Gonna work 2 jobs instead of Uber and Lyft. I'm already working 120+ hrs, making about 12 dollars an hour or less after gas, etc.

If I put that many hours into any regular job I'd be making nearly double and about 1000 miles less added to my car weekly."
SDSU,Needed 10 rides today to complete my bonus and it ended up taking 5 hours. I went a whole hour without a single offer and that was around 1 pm. This shit ain’t sustainable for people doing this to make a living.
SDSU,I’ve only ever driven for Lyft part time and the only times I’ve either driven for Lyft is for the bonus streaks. I used to double dip in each of those bonus streaks and make $400-500 in one work day in just 6 hours. I never tried doing it full-time nor did I ever believe that Lyft was meant to be a full time job in general. The infrastructure of it is just built for earning extra side cash to pay a couple of bills. I’ve thought that I would be paying a $3000 mortgage by driving for Lyft. It’s just not feasible. 🤷🏽‍♀️
SDSU,"If you take out the cost of wear and tear on your vehicle, the maintenance, etc on an annualized basis it’s extremely difficult to justify using ride share as primary mode of income. The only ones that can potentially make a case of it being lucrative are those that drive black- but even that is an extreme hustle, and the ones that make it with black have a mix of ride share and private clients or cash clients…then maybe you can make some $…otherwise it’s all a scam. 

What’s even more appalling is that despite exploiting their drivers , and charging their customers 2-3x what they are paying drivers - both Uber and Lyft have yet to really show their shareholders any real financial gains. They are both operationally inefficient, with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through their hands yet they are incapable of capturing enough of that flow to become profitable. 

At the end of the day, they both provide digital platforms that connect buyers and sellers …and still struggle. No one wins - drivers lose, customers lose, as do shareholders…that can’t be a sustainable model…"
SDSU,I wish you well with your new Job . You have done right my friend . I’ve been driving for Uber  and Lyft for nine years . I graduated this year with my Masters degree in occupational therapy . All I have to do is pass my board exam on next week Monday and I’m done driving full time for under and Lyft . It’s been along time coming but I’m so looking forward to a new rewarding career !
SDSU,Congrats. Looking back after you quit feels like being a former corner drug dealer. You can't believe you took so many stupid risks for so little.
SDSU,How narcissistic of you to think anybody gives a shit about you quitting Lyft that you have to make a dramatic announcement 😱
SDSU,"Nah, I multi app and only drive lyft if they give good bonuses. The delivery side pays way better. Pax/delivery is my full time job. I work when I want and make over a grand a week. Is only kind of job I'd do now."
SDSU,Why do people have to announce they aren't going to drive rideshare anymore?
SDSU,I agree. I’m driving temporarily until I secure a remote job. I just started driving about a month ago.
SDSU,Yea I agree ☝️.  Lyft still though is trying to pay too much.  They can literally offer $5 for 20 mile rides and see who stays and who does it.  Increase profitability
SDSU,Bye
SDSU,Good for you I wish everybody would do this. Use them then lose them.
SDSU,damn I just started and been applying to jobs as well.
SDSU,Who would be mad that u say that? Lyft isn't worth. I drive for them when they give me a great deal.
SDSU,"Be sure it a bonus, not a guarantee.  If it's a guarantee and 170 rides makes you $1999 lytf pays you $1.
This is a guarantee. You can make money, but it's a difference between the two.  
Earn $3,400 guaranteed by driving with Lyft in Portland. Apply here, and give 200 rides in 30 days: https://www.lyft.com/drivers/GRIGSBY22428?utm_medium=d2da_iacc Terms apply."
SDSU,"Use destination mode like it’s going out of style. Make sure you use a tighter time, otherwise they’ll run you around everywhere on long rides and you’ll never made the number.  Ask in your local market and see how they do it."
UT Austin,"Are you getting the emails for the Lyft credit? They send them out like every month and you have to add it to your account. It should be under the ""Promos"" tab in the Lyft app if it was added correctly. If it's there, double check that your pickup AND dropoff locations are in the correct zones. There's a different zone for pickup (pretty much just campus) and dropoff. If everything seems good, email nightrides@austin.utexas.edu, and they'll prob be able to help.

Here's the link to all the info: https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides"
UT Austin,"this might be obvious, but did you claim the lyft credits from the email that gets sent out every month and is the UT night rides pass showing up in the app?"
UT Austin,"You have to claim the promo credits like the other commenters said, and the email on your Lyft account has to be the same email associated with your UT profile (whether that's your @utexas.edu or your personal email account)."
UT Austin,no it’s been a thing for a long time. every month you get $100 in ride credits every month but it’s only valid in designated locations and at certain hours
UT Austin,"it was instituted after that girl got murdered on campus, except when they started it was unlimited rides 

good to see UT is decreasing the safety budget for students 🤘🏻"
UT Austin,I still get it even though I've graduated lmfao
UT Austin,I also got this - I’ve never gotten it before and I’m not sure what this means - I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help explain… does this mean I have to use it before January 1?
UT Austin,Is there any reason they don’t just give $100 credit? Do they have to prepay Lyft? If so then they don’t have anything to lose just giving credits. Or does UT receive credit back for unused rides
UT Austin,It’s so useless
UT Austin,"Check this out https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides

If you follow this, your account should be reloaded every month with $100 Lyft Pass"
UT Austin,are you sure you’re booking the ride while on campus and the destination is in an approved area?
UT Austin,"keeps happening to me too :( let me know if you figure out what’s going on

fyi on my friends’ phones they don’t see a price, they just see the word FREE. so if it ends up working that’s what you’ll see before you book the ride!"
UT Austin,"When you go to book a ride, it crosses out the price and shows up as ‘FREE.’ Atleast it should. Maybe you haven’t loaded the Lyft pass into your account. Or you can email the UT rides email."
UT Austin,[deleted]
UT Austin,I think you must also book the ride between the times 12am-4am if you haven’t been doing so already.
UT Austin,Is your account registered with your ut email address?
UT Austin,"I believe this is part of the UT Night Rides initiative, in which case see [here](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides) for those stipulations (i.e. from main campus from midnight to 4 A.M.), but otherwise it's legit."
UT Austin,"There is no downside, per say. You receive $100 credit every month and it only works from 11pm-4am. You have to be on certain areas by UT too. There's a helpful map/guide once you accept it under the Lyft sidebar explaining it better. 

The areas it covers range from Riverside to North Campus to East Campus to Wampus to Far West"
UT Austin,No.
UT Austin,Who funds this?
UT Austin,[removed]
UT Austin,"AFAIK, it's for night rides only. [https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides)"
UT Austin,"Yes, you can use it to go to 6th, but you have to choose a location in the pink on this site: https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides

Also, you can only use it to leave campus after midnight"
UT Austin,Yes you can use them to get 6th
UT Austin,"If you haven’t already, consider looking into the [UT night rides](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides) provided by Lyft. They cover most off campus areas where students typically live (see website for map of coverage)."
UT Austin,I take the bus at night. Just be prepared to fight for your life.
UT Austin,"Buses are fine, don’t worry about it. UT Night Rides will help you a lot, but only in certain neighborhoods.

Maybe get a bike/e-bike/scooter?"
UT Austin,"if you live within the boundary (all the way up to hyde park) you can use [sure walk](https://parking.utexas.edu/transportation/walking)! i'm not sure if there has been any changes since i last used it, but it's a free rideshare by ut to take you anywhere on ut campus to off campus between 8pm and 2am"
UT Austin,"When you say parking prices are ridiculous does that mean you have a car? An N permit will let you park on campus after 5 or 6 pm and wampus parking is generally free after 5 or 6 as well. As someone who takes cap Metro these are both lifesavers, I take the bus back between activities and park after hours if I know I'm staying late so I can drive myself back."
UT Austin,Free trauma
UT Austin,your degree gets you a UK work visa
UT Austin,There is Alr a master doc for UT students! I’ll circle back and give you the link when I find it!
UT Austin,"If you have not already done so, check out [FAQ: What benefits are available to students?](/r/UTAustin/wiki/studentbenefits) on the [r/UTAustin FAQ](/r/UTAustin/wiki/faq)."
UT Austin,"Full Office 365 access (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc) for the time you're at UT"
UT Austin,You have access to Kanopy (a film streaming service). Fun fact: you can also have a meeting with one of UT’s nutritionalists to come up with a custom diet plan
UT Austin,Your student id is free bus fare until you’re no longer a student
UT Austin,Free bus rides.
UT Austin,"Tableau training/certification is free for students!

UT Austin,Thanks
UT Austin,Free unlimited access to www.trimbox.io so you can easily purge the junk mail out of your inbox!
UT Austin,Free Lyft at night
Auburn,So I would look at the time that they apply. I used to think it was for rides during any time but I think during the week it’s from around 7-9pm or something silly
Auburn,you can check the program restrictions if you got to payments tab in your app and click on the program.
Auburn,"Good to hear. I only do early mornings now till NYSE opens on the day. Got too tired of DT being a pick-up clusterfuck. Hope you made a killin! Surge looked pretty heavy all night. 

If anything will help the whole power bill situation, it’s making good money. Get after it, tonight and tomorrow will be even better. Not sure how well you know the area but home game Friday’s have the best tippers out by 85. Not as great as just accepting every short ride DT but I’ve been able to make some great connections with some insanely successful people. Does wonders for honing networking and social skills too. 

Those who grind for their living gotta watch out for eachother. Stay hungry and make you that cash money. Auburn rewards those who take advantage of gameday and brave the FOMO. 

Stay safe out there!"
Auburn,"Drunk students are rude.  My kid did Lyft when he was a student at Auburn, he could swap some stories with you!!!"
Auburn,"I did my first degree in 2010-2012 and am finishing up another degree this year. I have also noticed a massive shift in the number of dickheads. They are all over the place. It's like fire ants came in and replaced the tree ants. I think it's generational. I grew up in the 90s. We were different. Certainly not perfect but I think much more tolerable. 

It makes me think of that Rage Against the Machine lyric. ""Fuck you - I won't do what you tell me."" Sums up the 90s culture I experienced. I think it's now, ""Fuck you - do what I tell you. Also, fuck you some more.""

Good luck out there. I hope your windows last."
Auburn,This new generation is so entitled. My gf teaches 10-12 grade and they are the WORST. The things they say to her boils my blood. I wish they would say those things in front of me. There’s no more common decency anymore. I’m sick and tired of these kids. My kids won’t act like this if it’s the only thing I can accomplish on this earth. I’m sorry you had to deal with that
Auburn,[deleted]
Auburn,"I’ve been working at Auburn for more than ten years now. That whole time I’ve supervised 20-25 student workers every semester, it gets worst every year. The group I have now can’t get off there devices to work. If we didn’t desperately need them I’d send them all packing! I can’t wait until everything we do can be done by AI. They’d better not bitch when it happens, because they did it to themselves. It’s the easiest job on the planet but you have to pay attention, that’s all. Yet they can’t manage to even do that. It’s really sad."
Auburn,"Unfortunately it is definitely the parents that do not discipline their children, schools and parents handing out participation trophies and making their children think they are so special and better than other people.  They are making them entitled little shits.  If they get in trouble, getting them out of it automatically instead of having them suffer the consequences of their actions so they learn to make better choices.  Trying to be their friend instead of their parents.  Trying to live vicariously thru their children.  I have a store and on the front door, I have a sign with a momma duck and little ducks following her - it says “this store is not childproof, please watch them.  I would have parents bring their young children in and just let them go - including toddlers.  I had to watch them cause contrary to what people think, when something gets broke and I don’t see who did it, it comes out of my pocket, insurance doesn’t pay for that.  First of all your insurance would cancel you.  You keep insurance for the big things that happen.  I had a lady literally letting her one year old playing with the jewelry and seeing nothing wrong with it!!  I had some little kid toys and so I took them out and gave them to her to distract her, which her mother should have been doing.  And then she went back to playing with the jewelry and I said no and gave her the toys.  Her mother just stood there and said nothing.  I was not mad at the child, mad at the parents that you just want them to leave cause I have had them break expensive statues etc.  I never let my kids run and play in a store.  A parents number one job is to raise their children to be functioning members of society and including being respectful of people.  Also not to feel entitled of their money and belongings.  Also to have respect for their life and other people’s life."
Auburn,From what I’ve noticed it’s down to parenting. A lot of gen z kids are never taught manners or are given whatever they want their entire life.
Auburn,"A lot of entitlement when I was attending. Also acceptance rates are pretty high and the school brand is pretty swaggy, so that’s part of the equation too (a lot of not so bright/humble people at a school with a bigger name); granted, I met some very smart people there, just radically different from when I was at a top five in that regard (that type was there too but filtered out a bit more). Still love Auburn, but that’s how I see things."
Auburn,"Minus the rideshare aspect, I’m a student currently and just going on campus is rough some days. Like people will literally walk all over you, bump you, push you, and then get mad at YOU. 🥴 And there’s always been a sense of entitlement from some but man has it seemed to have gotten so much worse."
Auburn,"Rich, white, entitled kids’ll do it"
Auburn,"I used to drive a taxi. People like that were part of the reason I quit 5+ years ago. It was extremely common (at least 2-3 on a busy night) and unfortunately isn’t new. I constantly had to fight people about smoking in the vehicle or getting in with open containers, dealt with kids dashing off without paying after getting to their destination, etc. I imagine it sucks that much harder when it’s YOUR car and you have that arbitrary, based-on-a-whim rating system that can rob you of that income."
Auburn,So sorry this happened to you. People can be so rude and ungrateful. Maybe your dream job is out there pulling you in another direction.
Auburn,Yeah I know what you mean but in a different way. I can’t imagine what it’s like being a Uber driver (or any other ride system) but you sound genuine. I’m sorry for your experiences but yeah it’s not just you if it makes you feel less alone. I’m a student myself right now (a junior currently) and I’m 20- I def feel the attitudes and vibe just change to more hostile around students who came last year and this year. Not to say my class wasn’t rude cuz there def are people that were rude but it just seems like even more. I’m sure having more freedom now is making people want to do whatever they want but I still can’t understand the rude behavior. All I wanted was to get out of my parents house too but I can’t imagine doing something like that to my Uber driver 💀
Auburn,that’s nice of you that you want to provide this service to people. sorry you’re encountering so many rude people. I think you are correct that individuals are less well mannered now than they were before the pandemic
Auburn,It’s not just students. People in general are vastly different. I worked customer service from 2012-2022 and there was a BIG difference from 2020-2022. People are leaving the service industry in droves because of it.
Auburn,"I saw a drunk woman arguing with a taxi driver, she kept yelling about how she couldn’t find her keys and he just wanted to get paid. It was clear She felt like if she played damsel in distress she could get out of paying and it was just hard to watch."
Auburn,Mad respect to the Uber drivers. Fuck anyone who gives any type of slack to an Uber driver.
Auburn,Something tells me the type of people needing an Uber home at 2am are not the type of people to read and careful consider other’s opinions on the subreddit xD
Auburn,"A tap on the car is better than puke going down the length of the car. 

Not my experience, but I've seen it."
Auburn,"You needing a car depends on where you live. I would say if you are near Walmart, then you're generally okay. Most apartment complexes have a transit stop so you can get to campus. Some places are pretty reasonably priced if you dont mind roommates"
Auburn,Car depends where you live. Housing very expensive downtown but there are places a mile or 2 off campus where price is great.
Auburn,"You can get along fine in Auburn without a car, if you are a cyclist and have appropriate gear (panniers, lights, rain gear, etc). With regard to home/class commute, you might even get to and from quicker on a bike."
Auburn,War Eagle! I have a friend who owns/rents duplex apartments. I sent her your post. Her places are perfect for grad students. Watch out for her (Jenny) to contact you.
Auburn,"Cheapest place to live is in the trailers off of Wire Rd (near the vet school). They are actually a pretty nice place to live but really cheap. As for a car, for school you could get away with just riding the transit. However, any thing outside of school, you will need some kind of ride. When you get bored, check out the links below. 

Chewacla State Park- https://www.alapark.com/parks/chewacla-state-park

Auburn,"I’d look at west elm apartments. They’re 1 bedroom/1 bath that are dated and small but right downtown and great value. I lived in super fancy places all through college and my extra year, and this is the only place I resigned a lease. Loved it."
Auburn,"I’m also from NJ! War Eagle! Having a car is definitely a plus but as mentioned, depends on where you’re looking to live. Grocery stores aren’t too far away no matter where you’re at but in my opinion living closer to campus is a bigger benefit, transits aren’t terrible but walking is more reliable."
Auburn,Auburn U also has a contract with Lyft and provides credits monthly! I would look into it!
Auburn,"If you are like me, just act at school and home. And live near a supermarket. Car is not necessary. Many communities has school bus station. 

But if you want to often play around, or your home is far from the supermarket. You better have a car. Although there is a shopping line bus every Friday, you don't want to use it. 

I live in a community close to Wal-Mart in the south, and I pay about $600 a month including water and electricity.  I’m a foreigner, I don’t know the  standard room rate, but it should be cheaper than the community surroundings of the school."
Auburn,"Which major are you in OP? Because I know if you're in engineering, the stipend is low but totally liveable. You don't have to have a car at first because the transit system is fine and goes to places like walmart and such. If you make friends they will absolutely take you places as well. My best friend was in COSAM grad school and never had a car, I just drove her anywhere she needed to go because it was time to hang out and also that's what friends do. The cost of living is pretty low in Auburn so you should be fine but the salaries in some departments are harder to get by than others."
Auburn,"If you’re looking for cheap small apartments (technically studios) check out magnolia studios! It’s across from campus...  I think next year its $525 with internet and cable included! There isn’t laundry in unit but there is laundry on the complex (I use my friends w/d). 

If you have multiple roommates look at eagles landing- it’s a full house in a little community! My friends mom owns some property in auburn and one of the places is in eagles landing- fully renovated with laundry included! There’s a bus stop that goes to campus and a bus on Friday that goes to shopping centers. It’s also near Walmart (it’s definitely a walk but you could also look into grocery delivery thanks to how much the world has changed lol).

There are some options near campus about 700 to 800 if you have a roommate (my friends mom also has a 2 bedroom she rents out that’s renovated). It’s definitely smaller but it’s close to campus and there is a bus stop if you don’t want to walk. 

Honestly, you’ll probably be good anywhere as long as there’s a bus stop or it’s close to campus!"
Auburn,The housing market is really competitive in Auburn and apartments get rented out really quick so try to find a place to live pretty fast
Auburn,"I’ve made the drive from NY to AU and it’s certainly a trek, but not impossible"
Auburn,If you need any local friends let's hang out!
Auburn,"Don't let anyone tell you how to feel about Auburn, it's what you make out of it just like any city/town. People from large cities tell you its small and boring, people from small towns say its huge with a plethora of activities to partake in. I come from a city of 7000 people, I enjoy Auburn, it's usually always teaming with life around campus.

Anyways, I'd suggest living near the university. I live 15 minutes away and I wish I was much closer. Also be careful with picking apartments and make sure yours has a washer and dryer.

TLDR: Comparison is the thief of Joy. In other words, don't have a bias and try and compare it to a large city like Atlanta. Make sure nothing is missing in your apartment that would make daily life a bit annoying such as a washer and dryer."
Auburn,"If you havent found somewhere to live yet, do it ASAP. Because places go fast and youre running outa time"
Auburn,"If you're in your late 20s I think Opelika is a more fun place to hang out. Better food, better drinks, cooler bars, and less of a chance one of your students will try to ask you homework questions."
Auburn,[deleted]
Auburn,"Housing Market here is pretty nuts right now, particularly Auburn. Heard great things about living in Opelika."
Auburn,"I'd also argue for Opelika. Auburn definitely has more food options, but good luck finding parking there during the main part of the school year to actually go eat anywhere downtown. Opelika is also growing,there'sa couple breweries, a distillery, a homebrew supply store/craft beer bar, a pinball arcade,tons of bars, a couple board game shops, and tons of other businesses opening up all the time as of late.

For me, Auburn is really only enjoyable on the summer and during winter break."
Auburn,"As far as where to live, it kind of depends on what you want out of a home. If you want to buy a house, Opelika may be your best option, and you’ll generally get more bang for your buck there. Since you’re new in town, you may want to be closer to downtown for at least a year, but that is going to be a younger crowd. Good luck, auburn is a great area."
Auburn,"Some places on South College, especially around Longleaf Drive, are both shifty and often unsafe. I wouldn't bother looking there, personally.  

Other posters are right about prices and availability. It's late in the season and the developers are all about selling condos to Mommy and Daddy.  But sometimes realtors will have older but okay rental houses east of Dean down to University. If you're coming with a huge salary, there are rental houses in most of the newer neighborhoods too."
Auburn,"Welcome to Auburn!  
  
Small town has its perks in that the people are really friendly, crime is relatively low, and commute to the office is less than 10 min. I moved here last fall from Omaha and the single thing that struck me was the cost of housing. Rent is absurd! I would be paying more here for less space than I would've in downtown Omaha. So if you haven't started looking to buy or rent, NOW is the time to do so or you'll find yourself in a pinch come August. 
  
I bought a condo in Auburn though looking back probably should've found something in Opelika. Opelika is a bit more adult oriented and I find I spend more social time there."
Auburn,"Be careful where you park. It can be difficult to find one that's close to where you need to be. If needed, you can speed about 5 miles over the limit. Also, there is a T-Rex skull on the second floor of the beard-eaves memorial coliseum"
Auburn,What does the ride-share situation look like?  I know it’s a college town but I feel like there are some places that can still be hit or miss as far as that goes.
Auburn,"Fellow young professional and Auburn grad here, I love Auburn more than anything, but go with Opelika."
Auburn,Best advice I can give you is understand that you’re not in St Louis or San Diego anymore. Definitely gonna be a culture change.
Auburn,"I sort of did the opposite, moved from Orange County, CA to go to Auburn as an undergrad and then moved back to San Diego. I can attest what it’s like leaving CA but I haven’t lived in Auburn for 6 years. Still glad to help answer whatever questions you have if you want to PM me!"
Auburn,"Saturdays (football home games) in the fall will be your biggest nightmare, unless you’re like me and love huge crowds and football. Otherwise avoid any of the roads close to the downtown and campus area on those days. Voodoo wings and Wingtown rock if you love wings. Chewacla state park is a fun spot. As far as night life, you will probably feel the most comfortable in downtown Opelika at John emerald distillery, and red clay and resting pulse breweries, being more laid back and not such a “college” crowd. Also there’s a wine bar in that area called Ampersand I believe. Welcome to Auburn! Hope you enjoy it. Definitely a small town vibe even though it’s not so small anymore. Also there’s 1000 coffee shops, I really like Mama Mochas."
Auburn,Local police force is required to make “contacts” (write tickets).
Auburn,"I don't agree with the Opelika people. If you want a quieter hipster-y place, then sure. But Opelika is further from the school, and drive time matters. If you're buying a house, I'd think twice about Opelika--it's way cheaper there because fewer people want to live there. House resale value is way better in auburn because auburn schools are some of the best in the state. If you switch jobs or don't get tenure or whatever, you'll want to sell your house quickly, and auburn guarantees that will happen. 

It's not like you can't still drive to downtown Opelika. 

I've lived here for 3 years now. 

Auburn has better parks as well. It seems to me the people suggesting Opelika in this thread are just saying the downtown life is better for you there, which is probably true, but since when is that the main criteria for where to live? Live close to where you work. 

Finally Auburn has zoning rules that mean some neighborhood are single family only, which means no student rentals. Live in one of those areas or be sad. Most the property management companies have listings divided as student or non- for this reason"
Auburn,"Love this area honestly. It has a lot to it if you know what you're looking for. I'm a huge foodie so there's tons of great Korean, sushi, bbq, soul food, Italian and other places to eat. Depending your style, you can do downtown Auburn bars which are crazy busy with the loud music send dancing and whole 9 yards. Opelika is more chill of a bar scene if that's your thing. There's also the Nerd Torch Cafe in Opelika that has a ton of gaming stuff, ax throwing in Auburn, indoor gun range at the firing pin, pinball in Opelika, and a host of fun live music each week at various bars. And Birmingham and Atlanta are just a 2 hr drive each if you miss the city life"
Auburn,"Coming from SoCal may be a bit of a culture shock. Auburn is a very southern and mostly conservative school. That being said I know and have friends from SoCal that love it, it’s really a personal thing so if you can visit and spend a weekend here I would recommend it.

As stated Auburn is a hard school for being a state school. Think it’s been ranked 5th hardest school to get an A at for the past few years. Once again take that with a grain of salt, but I definitely see it from my classes here. However that doesn’t mean you’ll be studying all the time either, just makes you “grow up” and realize how you learn faster.

Diversity can also be an issue. If this is something you want to take further auburn DM me and I can go into more detail.

Also since you are OOS. Auburn is a great, well known school here, but if you plan on going back home it will have little name recognition. 9/10 people I talked to when I worked in NYC had never heard of it, and if they had it was because of Football.

Generally OOS will get dorm rooms in the Hill. It’s not the best dorms in the world, but everyone I know ended up saying they weren’t as bad as they thought going into it. You may also get some of the nicer ones, but it’s kinda a lottery. 2 girls I dated were both OOS and lived in the Hill and still have some of their best friends from living there. Auburn also doesn’t require you to live in a dorm freshman year, so you can always get an apartment.

There are other small thing, but most of them I would consider a personal con that may be a pro for most people. Overall there isn’t a lot at Auburn I would consider a “con”. I had a choice of about 20 school and still ended up coming here and I have loved every minute of it.

My word of advice is to come spend some time here and get to know it. And I don’t mean Camp War Eagle either. Feel free to ask anything, I’d love to help.


*Edit* 
Read through some of your other comments, looks like you are interested in Greek life.
“Luckily” you are a girl so you won’t have to deal with flying here for summer rush events, just the week long beast that is girl’s rush. From what I know Greek life will be different from what it is in SoCal. Not crazy different, just scaled up and more intense. Average sorority pledge class is around 90 and something like 15 social sororities. Can’t help you to much though with sorority stuff since it is a lot different from fraternity stuff."
Auburn,"Shit parking on most of campus, downtown parking is getting worse, explosive population expansion, and a lot of construction. 

To counter the first two, it’s not wildly expensive to live close enough to walk to class within about 30 minutes and the bus is *typically* pretty good for the father apartment complexes, Uber and Lyft are usually $8-$16 downtown if you live remotely near campus."
Auburn,"NorCal Auburn Student here. Honestly, there haven’t been too many major cons, as most of the issues are common to colleges everywhere, like foreign TA’s teaching calculus with illegible handwriting. Parking can be a bitch, but I got an apartment close enough to campus to walk to class every day, and the school-run shuttle program is pretty solid and even does weekly “Friday shopping” routes to get you to grocery stores. It might not be super pleasant to live without a car, but it’s a lot better than dealing with the hassle of parking passes.

Classes are pretty straightforward to sign up for, but be sure to badger the hell out of your advisor to make sure you’re on the right path. Decided to take a choose-your-own-Adventure outlook on my engineering schedule and hooo boy, that almost screwed me hard.

I’ll edit my comment if I think of any more pressing ones.

Edit: minor inconvenience, but you have to pay for bike storage on campus, the community bikeshare has sorta gone to shit, and the campus is big. Leave extra time between classes you know will be far away from each other, especially early on when you need to jump back and forth between classes in your major (wherever those are) and general req classes that will most likely be in Parker or SCC. Don’t want to be running in the nasty high-humidity heat that lingers on either end of summer break."
Auburn,You don’t want the pros?
Auburn,"My roommate junior and senior year was from California. We were in the same pledge class and became good friends during sorority stuff.

She was familiar with southern culture because both her parents went to school in Texas so I don't think she was really shocked by it at all. She got along fine with girls here, so I don't think you'll have any trouble making friends.

The one thing she always hated was not having a car, I had to drive her everywhere, which was fine for the most part. There are shuttles to Atlanta airport so it's not like you can't get outta town when needed.

I would assume things like rent and food etc are way cheaper in Alabama, then what you're looking at in California, my rent while I was in school was $500 a month which included cable and internet and I was a block from campus, but you more than make up for it with oos tuition.

I think you should make your choice based on your education goals tho. Auburn is an amazing school, if you find yourself there, and you take advantage of all it has to offer, you won't be disappointed."
Auburn,"I just finished freshmen year, so I'm definitely not an expert, but I will say one thing that may differ from other colleges is that there isn't much going on at night on campus. I lived on campus without a car and found myself really bored in nights that I didn't have much homework. This is mainly because the majority of students live off campus in apartments, so once classes end campus dies down quickly."
Auburn,"There's not really anything in town aside from the school. There's no bookstore if you're looking for something beside textbooks (there's a Books-A-Million in Opelika, but I've never found anything interesting there); there's not really a music scene. I love Auburn, I made some good friends in my time here, I think I got a great education, but if I'd known that it was a borderline culture void, I would have strongly considered other schools"
Auburn,"The town is really dead outside of the University. This not only affects ""stuff to do"", but also the health of the townspeople outside of the University.

Unless you want to come to Auburn for the education, I wouldn't. There are better places to be. That said, everywhere has problems, and Auburn is far from the worst. It's relatively safe, good climate, the college provides a nice bubble with tons of cool/interesting people."
Auburn,"i graduated this may. no matter how bad you want to get away from home right now, it's going to suck big time for a while being so far away. all of my friends were driving distance from their families and went home almost every weekend and so i was alone a lot, especially freshman year because i came knowing no one and struggled really hard adjusting and making friends. unless you have the money to fly or friends you could go home with, things like fall break or easter weekend will be pretty lonely. 

i would not say it is a diverse school and as others have mentioned campus can be very conservative, so if that's important to you it's good to be aware of. it's something i wanted when i applied and ended up disliking by the time i graduated.

alabama in general doesn't have the greatest medical care and if you have a uterus i'm sure you heard it isn't the, uh, friendliest? right now, so again, if that's important to you, you should be aware.

&#x200B;

of course i am obligated to say it is a wonderful, beautiful school filled with a lot of incredible people. but you probably know that already!"
Auburn,Definitely the shuttle
Auburn,Your looking at a 30+ mile Uber even if they were out there.
Auburn,Anybody know where the shuttle pickup location is?
Auburn,Where can you park for the shuttle service? I have heard it is drop off only at shuttle?
Auburn,"Could see if there are any restaurant jobs available for night or weekend shifts. Or gig work like uber, doordash, etc. if you want to set your own hours"
Auburn,My youngest drove for Lyft and was able to set his own hours. It might work for you.
Auburn,"DoorDash but just don’t be their btch, be selective."
George Washington,"SEAS DLC :)

Those are additional free resources specifically available for the superior SEAS students. A lot of them will require you to request the access by email and/or be on GW network (GW Wireless or GW VPN).

George Washington,"Thanks for compiling!!! That capital bikeshare is quite a discount, I can't believe they don't advertise this to students more."
George Washington,"Just an FYI some of the things listed are for employees only such as ibuy, efax or jabber and are not available to students unless they work for the university and even then its dependent on your role/position. Also you have the wrong link for VMware. It should be: https://www.seas.gwu.edu/vmware. 

ArcGIS is used by civil engineers to track traffic/movement patterns and is also useful for environmental engineers to create hydrology maps etc. Azure Dev Tools is for Microsoft software so you can get things like Windows 10 Education Edition or Microsoft Project (which is not included in 365). There’s also the ability to build VMs using Azure online. Also, Autodesk is free for all students enrolled in university/college, you just have to create a student account and they verify enrollment."
George Washington,They added a stop after making the pickup/dropoff at the airport lmao... Lyft didn't update the price (means it is so horrible they don't want to show you)
George Washington,This had to be a mistake. There is no way.
George Washington,WTF!
George Washington,More and more people are adding stops after we are ALREADY driving for a couple minutes…it updates to 10 cents more. I wonder if this is new “hack” with passengers cuz I never had this happen before as much as recently.
George Washington,You drew a penis.
George Washington,And a stop. Lucky you
George Washington,Ain’t no way
George Washington,Come on that can’t be real. Maybe missing a zero? That is nauseating.
George Washington,"How is this even possible? This should be illegal, in Washington State this shouldn't happen because of legislation passed. That's slave pay."
George Washington,Lol kick em out at the first stop. This is on you.
George Washington,It just gets worst 😭
George Washington,You owe lyft after gas for doing this
George Washington,Some top dawg took it
George Washington,Sucks that company feel sorry for all new guys
George Washington,someone still took it
George Washington,"Yah really love attention from reddit users….

We’ve seen these screenshots 100000 times why do you people continue spamming  this stupid shit."
George Washington,"Madison hall is probably the best freshman can do in terms of location, if you have classes that aren’t in Elliot it’s a bit of a walk for thurston to get to like the side of campus with more of the lecture halls like Rome/phillips or Tompkins. West hall is probably the best hall freshman have access to since you would have a private bedroom and a common space as well as everything else west has access to: gym, dining hall (tho pelham isn’t that good), black box theater, etc. only problem is it’s on the vern which is honestly not that bad besides the vex being awful to deal with"
George Washington,"Potomac -1, Guthridge -2, madison -3, Lafayette -4, Thurston -5, Mitchell -6 and all Vern last.
I’ve seen the plans for the Guthridge renovation and it should be very nice and is transferring to a freshman dorm. Thurston is only so low due to communal restrooms and small bedrooms so if that doesn’t bother you then it could move up."
George Washington,Potomac is quiet and has large and new rooms. It’s great because you don’t have communal bathrooms but you’ll most likely have to share with another double. If you get Potomac definitely become acquittances with your suitemates it will help a lot!! You’ll lose the social aspect of Thurston because you won’t really know the people on your floor but I highly recommend as a freshman dorm.
George Washington,https://drive.google.com/file/d/19YjUVM5hB3A84r4U1epG-E6Tobrlbmfe/view?usp=drivesdk
George Washington,Vex is abysmal so dont go for the vern 👍🏻
George Washington,"1. potomac: own bathroom, decent size room and storage space
2. madison: good location but kinda old
3. thurston: new, very social, but small rooms and no private bath
4. district: big rooms 
5. LaFayette: big rooms 
6. guthridge
7. jj
8. mitchell
9. west hall (vern)
10. somers (vern)
11. all other vern dorms"
George Washington,big chance you will be put on the vern. but as a rising senior im telling you that GWU is going downhill. the housing process is a mess. you will be better off committing to another school. save your money and your mental health.
George Washington,"It’s truly a good community. I was never on the vern but I always hear amazing stories of how the connections made are fruitful and quality. I know many that were happy about it and also GW tries as hard as they can to promote the vern so there are tons of events with free food and activities. Also, ngl the nighttime free Lyfts back to the vern is kinda a flex. 

It’s the best way to have a proper college experience with a big outdoor campus and all the amenities you need."
George Washington,"I always say that the Vern itself is really nice, it’s the commute that’s annoying. 

The Vern has that more traditional campus feel, and it’s much quieter and more peaceful, so I think it’s a more chill environment, which I really liked as a freshman. I think it’s also easier to make friends on the Vern in comparison to Figgy Bottom, because you see the same faces a lot more (although I personally made my friends through students orgs, but that’s more because I was really shy as a freshman). I also think the dining hall on the Vern is the best dining hall on campus in terms of quality, and I think it’s because they have to cater to fewer students, so the quality is better (although the foggy bottom dining halls are improving). 

Overall, I really enjoyed living on the Vern, and I liked the fact that it was much quieter and more peaceful. I think the commute is annoying, but the Vern itself I think is really nice"
George Washington,The West Hall gym is usually empty. They have pianos and practice rooms as well.
George Washington,"I think the campus is more peaceful, soccer field, honestly id wanna live in the Vern if not for its location"
George Washington,"You might not stay friends with the people you meet on the vern freshman year, but you will immediately and forever click with anyone who lived on the vern at some point. Alum, upperclassmen, whoever. You can use the vex as an excuse for being late as it is, in fact, ALWAYS running late. It’s a quiet campus if you are into that (I wasn’t, but midterms and finals hit you really hard, and it’s nice to come home and force yourself to be… home). If you live in west, that building is pretty good (facilities are super accessible). If you don’t, you get to dunk on the west hall kids who do kinda have it better (west hall best hall but like it IS an unfair deal if you’re on the hillsides). Lyfts are helpful… to an extent. You can be your buddies lyft pass as well, so its way easier to have late night hang outs now than it used to be. Otherwise make of it what you will. There’s a lot of downsides but you find what you love about it in your time. And then coming to campus is even better (plus you know how to budget better)."
George Washington,The campus itself is better in basically every way. It’s just that its location sucks and you have to Vex over to Foggy to do anything.
George Washington,"The nice thing about it is basically a complete lack of adults in the room if you’re into that, I never ran into a CC or anything like that"
George Washington,buff and brew
George Washington,You get to play Escape the Vern! Nothing like Type B fun for bonding
George Washington,"The Vern campus wise is very nice. It’s near some restaurants and a small town, which sometimes has flea markets. Also I’ve known some individuals who were able to get pet sitting, dog walking and babysitting jobs in the past. 
However, in my opinion the best part of the Vern is the Lyft pass. After midnight you can get a Lyft back to the Vern if you are out (which is really nice as you get to skip the hassle of getting back to your dorm) and on Saturday there is a pass to get to the shoppers which is lovely as it makes it easy to get groceries back!"
George Washington,I used to go to the Vern on the weekends just to sit in the library there
George Washington,Buff
George Washington,"Zero supervision could be an upside? I’m not going to lie, though. I hated it. Here are some ways I coped: locking myself in study rooms at eckles (great vibes there), getting the delish pastries from buff and brew, getting up an hour and a half early for all my classes to avoid the vex rush, reserving study rooms in gelman for when I had to stay on foggy all day, SITTING IN THE FRONT OF THE VEX whenever I could because it felt like my tits were falling off from the bumpiness in the back, and getting up to watch the sunset from the cute flowery benches in front of Ames hall. Picnics with friends are also great. Tip: if the study rooms in eckles are full or u want to study late use the ones in Ames. They are open much longer and you can eat in them."
George Washington,"Any NYC trip from our area is undoable anymore. On Friday night, I was offered a mere $74 to drive from NE Philly to Coney Island of all places which would've been a 2.5+ hour trip one way with over $40 in tolls. A year ago, if I didn't want to deal with multiple rides or if it was a slower night, I would've EASILY accepted the trip because it would've paid close to double. And I can work all of NJ so I could do rides on the way back if I wanted, despite being very inconsistent. I'm a driver who used to love the longer trips but I can't do the majority of them anymore solely based on pay alone."
George Washington,"That's insane. When I first started driving for Uber 4 years ago the regional rail line was down. So people were taking Ubers from Philadelphia to NY. I got paid 206 for the ride and a 100 dollar tip. 

Tip aside a trip that far should be at least 150 dollars. That's fucked up."
George Washington,I dont do rides longer then 45 minutes and i will only do it if it pays minimum $35. And i dont do any rides that are less then $8. Because anything else its not worth driving for.
George Washington,Took similar ride with lux but to Newark airport from there.  Paid 220
George Washington,Haha.  Reminds me of when Lyft offered me $60 to drive someone from Sacramento to Fresno.  Just enough to cover gas! What a joke.
George Washington,I would not have taken this ride. Periodt.
George Washington,I’ve seen worse
George Washington,"Literally 99 percent of rides from the suburbs such as CT, NJ, and middle to eastern Long Island to nyc/ or the three major airports is not worth it to drivers in those markets time and moneywise, between the massive cost in tolls/ dead heading back with no chance to make any money on the way back you’d have to a complete moron to take those rides. And that’s not even factoring in the terrible road conditions, traffic, red light and speeding cameras every half fucking mile, the bike lanes and other bullshit, fuck the city….I lived in nyc for 36 years I’m glad I got the fuck out in time"
George Washington,Good luck with the traffic
George Washington,The other day I picked up a pax in Princeton going to Brooklyn ended up being $89 for the ride plus a $5 bonus.
George Washington,Im not a driver but I would think that the new manhattan congestion fees would be a killer
George Washington,Trash. Decline !
George Washington,Gig economy on the whole has gone tits up
George Washington,I had one earlier that was 2hrs 15 minutes for $55 over 100 miles
George Washington,"Round trip, after gas, taxes, ware and tare, congrats you made 4 bucks an hour."
George Washington,The rides coming from nyc TCL license drivers going out of ny are good pay but coming back the raters suck
George Washington,This is when you ask the pax how much they're paying and ask if they'd rather just cash app it and cancel in the app and drive them that way
George Washington,Airport around here about same mileage.  Pay is never over $50.
George Washington,"I swear you guys photoshop this shit lol. I live in New jersey, gave a ride from cape may to union yesterday and got paid $220. Ive never seen rates this low"
George Washington,"First, congrats! Being accepted is always an amazing feeling and exciting opportunity to propel your career forward. I am also a MLT, I work full time and am currently enrolled at GWU in the fully online MLS program. First, it’s doable, but extremely exhausting and stressful and don’t expect to have any kind of balance in your life. If you give yourself a free day to be with friends or family or do something you enjoy, you’re definitely regretting it when it’s time to cram for the exams…. Unless you have a photographic memory, the time commitment and repetition with the material needs to be honored and respected, because a it’s a lot… also, You do not get breaks. Spring semester finals are on a Friday, and summer classes start the immediate Monday following, and same with summer to fall classes. The only break you get is the fall finals (which is usually the Friday before Christmas) to January 2 or 3. So typically 10days at most… which personally I feel is unrealistic for most people in this program… full time workers or full time parents… both very demanding. Also they make it very clear that there are no extra credit opportunities. Your grade is mostly based on tears and quizzes. Most classes do not have many other assignments (or at least assignments worth enough points or weight) to balance any undesirable test scores for someone with severe test anxiety. 
 I am preparing for my clinical rotations in spring and the clinical coordinators at GWU are telling us that if working is necessary, you limit your hours to 20 hours per week. After speaking with my boss about that, it’s completely unrealistic. I can’t go down to part time just for a few months in order to do clinical rotations (maybe other hospitals are able to be more flexible but I’m just sharing my experiences with and surrounding the GWU MLS program). So now I’m stuck trying to figure out how to make it work. They do offer splitting your clinicals between 2 semesters (for example taking 2 in spring and 3 in summer) but that is because you are required to completely practicing courses at the same time as your rotations. Which include weekly assignments, quizzes, and a final exam at the end of the rotation (which the clinical coordinators really emphasized need to be taken very seriously). Currently, I am completely overwhelmed trying to figure out what to do. 
Let me also say I do not know how other programs operate. I didn’t know all this before starting at GWU but also didn’t get to research many other programs. Some may allow better balance and some reasonable breaks in between semesters, I’m not sure. I think it’s worth exploring if this kind of experience is inevitable regardless where you go or if GWU doesn’t care about having unrealistic expectations and no flexibility or compromise. 
Everytime I tell someone I’m in the program at GWU the response is always “wow that’s a great school” but I honestly don’t know if this cost, stress, and demands are worth it. 
If you made it this far, thanks for reading. This is my current experience with GWU. I’m sure other have had their own unique experience that may be better than mine, but this is my honest experience"
George Washington,"Just an FYI a lot of PA schools dont care about MLT classes for their GPA calculations. 

I tried for years to get into PA school and even having a 3.98 MLT GPA and 10 years working as and MLS - they only looked at my BS Biology GPA which was like 3.0. 

I asked after a rejection if they considered my LAB classes at all they said no. The schools with PA and Lab may well be an exception to that so best of luck. 

But I hope it goes well for you. Ive pivoted and and am starting nursing school so I can do an ARNP instead since PA never worked out for me."
George Washington,"It was a potential program for myself except the price was too steep for me.

Congrats !"
George Washington,They make you test with monitoring software that has really strict rules. Friend went there but she was anxious and miserable the whole time. Good luck!
George Washington,congrats!!
George Washington,I did the post bacc program at GWU while I worked full time as a compounding pharmacy tech. It was doable but definitely very stressful at times. I quit my job after didactics and just did my 4 months of clinical rotations full time so that I could get it done and not have a bunch of time between didactics and my cert exam. I’m on the West Coast so my clinicals were through a local hospital that contracts with GWU. The hospital is very picky about the quality of students they get and only contracted with two schools at the time. They felt GWU had the most prepared students.It worked out really well for me. That’s awesome that you have employer help with education too! Let me know if you have any questions.Congrats!
George Washington,Hey!  I applied and just got notification of an interview.  Can you tell me more about what the interview was like and what questions they asked?
George Washington,"Hello, I applied to GW’s MLS blend program today. Did you have an interview? How long does it take time to get an acceptance notice? Also, how many students are in the one program? Thank you!"
George Washington,I’ve been stuck in this Lyft rental program for a month slaving away and it helped me out because I was out of a car but they pay you less when using the rental. I struggled to make the payment. I’m just now getting out of it
George Washington,"Rental programs are a joke and predatory, nothing new

Most markets you want the ability to use Uber and Lyft, but with rentals, you can't."
George Washington,"I really don't understand how it would be a surprise?  If you get a company vehicle, you have to be generating enough revenue to pay for the car AND yourself no matter what.."
George Washington,"I asked about this yesterday but IMO the only viable reason to rent a car is if your car is in the shop needing repairs or as in my case, I was thinking of doing it just to test the waters of doing Lyft/Uber type driving but don’t currently have a qualifying vehicle to do it. Mainly in order to see if I like doing it and test the waters of my area before buying a used car."
George Washington,"Just sharing my two cents here with the Lyft express drive: i just got out of it today, it was a month and a half of mixed feelings with the car. I got better tips and i worked pretty much every day for 10 hours. Yes, gas took away a good chunk but I got enough to pay my bills and stay afloat while looking for another car and another job. I got those last week. For me it worked out okay but the fees are ridiculously high and gas prices are no help either. Ponder your options if you are out of a car and need one. But you really gotta get out of it quickly and get a steady income besides Lyft."
George Washington,"Per mile and per minute rate is less with a rental then it is normally! Do not rent from Lyft , modern day slavery"
George Washington,"Hey that's crazy I LITERALLY been waiting for one of these posts to pop up for like 2 weeks now , so I was driving for Lyft for a month I was homeless my older cousin helped me get the deposit and helped me get a bank account , I had a electric car a kira Niro Ev 2023 the first few weeks was cool and chill I wasn't really bothered by nobody for perspective (I'm black 25 with 1 daughter in my life a newborn to be exact) so you can imagine nothing really bothers me from arguing amongst riders people eating in the car people tryna flirt with you ( both female and male) 
It wasn't till maybe the month mark I started noticing little things like for one my weekly rental fee supposed to be 330 nothing higher or more that's with the insurance and fees they said man I noticed I been getting 487 weekly rental charges weekly and then I noticed the toll of driving all day and night then driving back home  I would drive in Sacramento all over to the valley and Santa Cruz but nobody told me that for one that there's no evcs chargers down the central valley area as far as level 3 and up be lucky there's a level 2 around , then the slow days I gotten so many slow days in the valley I never drove in Stockton for the reason of a bad experience of almost getting shot during a ride , like I literally had to either sleep in the car for the weekdays to actually have energy to drive to Sacramento  then drive back home , I wasn't eating cause I wouldn't make enough money it was just so many variables and Lyft was just no help at all I was a pure t star driver not one single low review or none of that platinum driver and what Lyft do leave out vital information I learned to only drive for Lyft and Uber with your own car or have a job on top before even driving Lyft cause those fees are ridiculous but on the bright side of you get in a accident in they car you can always get you a new one as long as it wasn't your fault"
George Washington,"I rent a car and pocket about 800-1000 after rental fee and gas per week driving 6 days 8-10 hours. I live in a big city. Personally this is enough to live on and save quite a bit too. The money is there if you put the time in, but the hours could bother some people. Lyft barely feels like work to me so I'm able to easily grind the 50-60 hours per week without burnout."
George Washington,Renting a car is for those in a dire situation or suckers.
George Washington,"I crashed their shit car, didn't even pay the 500 deductible, still let me drive for them in the new whip before completely quiting shit exploitative ride share gigs"
George Washington,It's indentured servitude
George Washington,"Got a rental as my car was hit by a DD while I slept. 

My area flexdrive just bought a ton of hybrids 2023. I got one. Had 7 miles on it when I picked it up. I get about 50 mpg and fill up every 2 days of driving vs everyday in my personal vehicle. 

It is 300 a week towards the rental and fees but I am going to get reimbursed on that from either my insurance or the DDs insurance. (DD insurance is trying to claim the driver was not insured.)

But yeah the rates are lower. But the gas is much better. 30 bucks every 2 days. 

You have to put on miles for it to be worth it."
George Washington,Rented for a year loved and hated it never had a problem until my car broke down. Hertz billed me for the world and claims I still owe $150 today. They don’t care about anyone lyft nor hertz will help me. So I’m done with the both of them forever…
George Washington,I drove my own vehicle- a 2020 Chevy Traverse for a couple months last year for Uber and Lyft. An 8-passenger car supposedly gets the premium rate per trip. I was shocked at the low payouts I was getting daily versus the mileage and wear on my vehicle so I quit. Turns out the Detroit (mine) and San Francisco markets have the 2 lowest payout rates in the nation. Fucking ripoff.
George Washington,Renting is easy for me because I can actually make $300 a day but only on Mondays....For some reason it's more profitable. I don't have to worry about maintenance..All I have to do is put gas and keep it clean...You have to grind I'm already into making my money. Plus I drive a M7 series Beamer I can protect my investment by keeping my mileage down... To each its own....I still can make at least about $1k a week....What y'all doing? I know Lyft plays games but I only do rides that makes sense time wise and money wise....Maybe not look for big long trips...I take short to somewhat medium rides
George Washington,"Lyft, Uber or whoever the fuck else is in business for one reason to make a profit.  They don't give a fat babies ass except for their bottom line.  The fact that these COCKSUCKERS can get away with taking almost 2/3rds of the fare is outrageous.  It wasn't like that when it started but now that so many people are out of work the gig economy is overflowing with people which allows them to fuck all of us with a soft dick.  This is the way of the world. They also know that the majority of the people who drive for them don't have the necessary degrees to do anything better.  Now degrees don't equate to intelligence it's nothing more than a passport to get your foot in the building with still no guarantee for a job.  It also doesn't help that this country is a corporation run by corporations.  For instance look what happened recently in Illinois(correct me if I'm wrong), where the Governor who was clearly bought By Uber vetoed a bill that would made drivers employee's and not contractors. If this would have passed it would have created a snowball affect to other states and cities. So don't ever expect a company like Uber who made a net profit of over 14 billion to give a fuck about us...14 billion dollars and all they are is nothing more than a match making app for car services."
George Washington,"It’s not for everyone or every market. I managed to pay my 260 every weekend in two days over the span of 6 hrs each day. The rest of the week was gravy. I could do more rides or a regular job/side hustle. $10 of gas got me $200 in rides or other. You think your own car will be any better? Let’s say $500 for your car payment…$200 for your insurance. Gas…. Then incidentals like new tires…. Maintenance… it’s the same shit just how you pay for it. You pay 1000 a month but don’t have to also save half of your income incase shit happens to your car. Tires all four will be $800 upfront. With the rental you pay for the rental that week not $800. There are pros and cons and If you hustle it’s doable if you don’t like hustling and choosing what days you do what and when…then yes the rental is not for you. Your market can suck also making the rental a bad move too, but it also isn’t a bad move for everyone. 

It’s not for you if you have a car with a car payment. 
It’s not for you if your market sucks ass
It’s not for you if you can afford and are capable of getting a car financed. 
It’s not for you if you aren’t structured in your work."
George Washington,For me personally I rent because my car went up and insurance refused to cover full cost. Took the insurance money and got the rental. I make my rental payment in about 14 hours of work and leaves me 5 days of profit. I’m in the Las Vegas market so it’s constantly busy but can’t speak for anywhere else.
George Washington,This mf has never seen a period in their life.
George Washington,[deleted]
George Washington,"Totally not worth it, high rental fees and low payouts."
George Washington,Not even an option in the Detroit metro.
George Washington,Water is wet....
George Washington,Big scam i grinded a month upgraded to Tesla rental to save on gas i was doing $80 gas daily driving 12hrs online time. if you don’t plan to drive 7 days a week 9-12 hrs you will find yourself in a big financial hole also with hertz rental thru Uber. Thankfully i stopped. Did school full time got nice financial aid check nd put that down on a 2021 Prius prime now I’m back driving lyft nd It’s worth it.
George Washington,"I can only imagine how rough it is. I don't rent a car from them and find the money not worth it. I tried driving to make a little extra bill money. The app crashes my phone and when it does work, the trips are just not worth it regardless of the time of day."
George Washington,Reminds me of predatory yellow cab practices. Except those drivers were forced to borrow up to $100K and basically be enslaved for decades to pay it off. At least you can get out of this one in a month.
George Washington,"Not to mention they cut your per mile and per minute in nearly 50% on top of the cost of the rental, they give you tons of streaks in the beginning and then poof no more leaving you to literally die out there!"
George Washington,"I mean, what did you really think?"
George Washington,Also don't do it unless you are ready for them to pull the plug without warning and kill the program in your area.
George Washington,"And yet people still think renting a car is a GOOD idea. There are even more than rent Teslas thinking they are going to make big bank, but are in for a big surprise when they are working their tails off just to make the rental payment."
George Washington,AGREED!  I’m in the hole with Lyft due to the ridiculous electric car rental they offered.  I was given rides as low as $2.30 and hardly ever received anything over $10….you literally work 24/7 and pay them an astronomical amount for the rental AND you are required to meet their minimum amount of drives also for the week.  Your literally working for them to increase their earnings and we get screwed!!
George Washington,i do not understand why anyone would choose this model unless lyft was their full-time job though. i make 400 a day but thats only with this as my main. i can’t survive with this as a side hustle
George Washington,"The rental program is really for full times drivers who average about 100-135 trips a week and make at least 1000-1500 a week.

Only way u can win otherwise is if you have other main sources of income. And u use Lyft to avoid putting miles on your car"
George Washington,"A heard about ""Ryde""  a decentralized  driver owned network, I hope they launch soon https://ryde.tech/"
George Washington,Its like 8.50 an hour
George Washington,It’s modern indentured servitude. I had to bust my ass just so I’d have a car to get to work. I made them so much money and never broke even and had to pay to work for them for months. I would drives for hours a day and it still wouldn’t even end up being $50.
George Washington,"I'm renting the Tesla right now, mainly to test drive it before buying one lol."
George Washington,Capitalism at its finest
George Washington,"It’s almost as if everyone’s experience is different…

Just because it doesn’t work for you doesn’t mean it doesn’t work for everyone."
George Washington,"And yet, I was still able to work hard and save for 3 years and buy a brand new Honda CRV. 

Hard work, yes.  Nothing worthwhile is easy, or everybody would do it.

It is STILL an opportunity."
George Washington,"They overcharged me, they have a lawsuit coming. A big one"
George Washington,Idk what ur doin wrong but I only drive 4-5 days a week and make 1000+ after expenses 😋
George Washington,"Unfortunately Lyft and Uber have become modern day slavery, with no real intervention from the law they are literally paying about $7-8 per hour once you factor ALL the expenses plus taxes, McDonalds its a better option at this point  with the way they’re flat out taking 80% of what customers pay is just doesn’t make sense to do it at all"
George Washington,"They can be useful in emergencies when you just gotta keep that income stream steady. Learn how to be a more efficient endentured servant to their system and you'll pull more cash. The way I see it, sometimes the vehicle usage and even a $40 come up out of a whole week is better than $0 cuz you sat in ur ass at the crib eating cheetos and masturbating at your parents house because honestly you can do that in the car too on ur way to pick up passengers.  At that point ur like 3-5 birds with maybe 2 stones"
George Washington,If anyone rents from left they are really stupid.   Look. If you don’t have a car then rideshare isn’t for you.   People are stupid
George Washington,Just went through this. It was easy. Everything was deductible. I owed $2 nd the filing fee for the $11k i generated in 3 months. 9k income. Worked rideshare for those 3 month yes. $2 dollars.
George Washington,Stop spreading false info and stop being lazy
George Washington,You realize you can get the money back at the end of the year in tax returns for miles/rentals/depreciation on vehicles if it’s due to business and you’re a 1099 contract worker right?
George Washington,Guess you have issue for the weekly cost for rental? Lol
George Washington,Just keep on slaving until you can pay the minimum down payment for your own car. Then you won't be renting from Lyft and you'll get away from Lyft slavery and join in Grub hub Uber and other Slave apps.🥰 Keep stacking up and use the saving option in the Lyft Direct app of need be.
George Washington,"I used the car rental to get a job, lol. I just drove on weekends to pay the fee. But back then it was cheaper."
George Washington,I’m going to be that guy. Duh.
George Washington,I’ve been doing it for over a year. I have my reasons but honestly I make enough driving Uber and playing poker to cover the fee every week. They recently started requiring 20 rides per week which I’ll do when they offer a bonus and it cuts down the rental fee a bit.
George Washington,Why in God's name would you think that would be a good business decision? Some of you all need to go work for someone because you obviously can't work for yourselves
George Washington,It's all part of the Lyft experience. Embrace the suck!   Lol
George Washington,Now we understand upfront pay…it’s a way for them to screw renters from rate cards.
George Washington,You are also forgetting the most important thing is taxes are going to be a bitch for you because you are a 1099 independent contractor
George Washington,A program like Flexdrive or an approved private rental company sucks less if you get the unlimited mileage...at least then you can multi-app (which is what I did before I finally bought).
George Washington,I just drive enough to keep it for my personal use.
George Washington,Why not rent a car from somewhere else? Im not a lyft driver jw
George Washington,"I drive a rental and just started with Lyft. I stay outside Chicago, but went downtown and around lakeshore area. I’ve already made, more than my rental, within 3 days…maybe just focus on, making the rental first and then, do more rides, so you can have more money yourself. You signed up for the rental and knew, what came with it. I’d rather pay for a rental, than have all that damage/wear and tear, on my vehicle. Nothing wrong with, renting a car through Lyft"
George Washington,A bike and door dash no o fee no gas
George Washington,Well duh? They arent just gonna rent you a car to do what you want... They rent you a car so you work their platform... What you thought you could just have your own car for cheap?
George Washington,I was just talking to driver the other day and mentioned I might try driving with the Lyft and she mentioned this program. Definitely glad I read this post before signing up.
George Washington,"Do it if there's a bonus involved to play for it. However, the rate card is 30-40,% compared to the rate card of an individual who drives their personal vehicle"
George Washington,All facts. I practically lived in my rental with Lyft. Ugh. But I ended up buying my own car.
George Washington,Facts
George Washington,Do you fools not read a contract or know how to use a calculator before signing them? SMH...
George Washington,Well yeah that’s driving
George Washington,Indenture service
George Washington,"Same goes if you buy your own car. The mileage and wear on the car goes before you even pay the car off. 

I agree with everything you say...except get your own car."
George Washington,I pay $250 per week for my rental
George Washington,To be fair I don’t understand why you want to rant about something you should have already known
George Washington,Lit any newcomers b4 u get into this program i strongly advise u have money put aside for the car itself and gas.  And your goal should be 150-170 a day that way u can put gas and stash a few bucks everyday
George Washington,"Well, if you can’t do the basic math of it’s gonna cost you X number of dollars before you make any money than you deserve to be broke either way. But it’s in your area. It makes sense to do it rather than not do it then you should go ahead and do whatever you want."
George Washington,When I used to do the rental program is 2019 it was 297 a week …how much is it now?
George Washington,Y’all are not using it correctly
George Washington,"I remember renting a few years back, they did note that people who rent with their express program do get paid less from their fares. And then a few months later they would even pay the express rental drivers even less when they updated the pricing.
This was when their cars was 274 a week. Excluding the 200 deposit."
George Washington,"Guys you have to put in the numbers different to see the whole figure in the end. 
The Lyft rental is now: 
$280      A WEEK
$1120     A MONTH
$13,340 A YEAR

Now think about…you buy for example a new Toyota Corolla Hybrid. On the Toyota Homepage this car cost you: 

Fair credit score of 650
Down $2000
48 Months finance 
———————————
Total: $605/ Month

So let’s compare:

                        Finance             Lyft Rental
Month             $605                 $1,120
Year                $7,260               $13,340
48 Months     $29,040            $53,340
Savings          $24,300            $0

48mo            + $34,300         + $0"
George Washington,"hertz gave me a broken car I couldn’t use to work, and when I tried to return it they said I was 3 minutes late and charged me $180 for the whole weekend and Friday.

I actually quit over this, never had a temp agency steal from me or make me work for free"
George Washington,I’m glad I read this. I just canceled my rental reservation for the express drive. Seems like exploitation to me.
George Washington,"Yeah currently in this situation, 361 a week for the rental. Plus gas. But I need a car, and they make so much off you doing this! They even pay less per ride when you have one of the hertz vehicles!"
George Washington,What happens if I’m missing like 5 dollars for the weekly rental
George Washington,"A few years ago I had to contact every time because they reimbursed tolls at a reduced rate based on an outdated toll fee schedule. They knew what they were doing then and do the same thing now just way more egregious.

There's no winning with them. Execs will still clink champagne glasses to celebrate our exploitation."
George Washington,In nyc I used have rideshare companies pay the tolls to pick up customer in Staten Island and bring them back to Brooklyn or Manhattan.  But now Lyft and Uber state they only reimburse drivers when the rider is in the car and is going through a bridge or tunnel with a toll.  Before they used to push the cost to the customer if there was a toll so a driver can reach them and pick them up but I guess they got some backlash from customers not willing to pay for tolls when they aren’t in the car which only extends wait time and creates surges during peak time in Staten Island
George Washington,[deleted]
George Washington,Here in Orange County in California they still have it. Yesterday in the evening got paid for using 241 and 261.
George Washington,I drove about a month ago went through two tolls and they only paid me 1/2 of what I paid. Then I had to pay them to get home or take back roads adding two hours. Lyft is getting very tight and cheating drivers.
George Washington,When will all companies learn that their scripted happy horse shit from CSRs does NOT make me cared for or valued. It pisses me off.
George Washington,"After driving with them, I no longer ride with the. Since I don't really tip for rides as I can't afford it (I'm sorry, but rich clients who have serious money have repeatedly not tipped me, these are the people who can and should tip), I ride with uber where at least know the driver is not being offered 1 to 3 dollars for the ride.."
George Washington,I’m done with LYFT the Garden State Parkway was the only way to go from Rochelle Park to Irvington $2.02 at the toll not included in the upfront price!!! I will delete this trash 🗑️ app
George Washington,"They don't have to pay for tolls, as long as drivers still drives for them knowing the information."
George Washington,I was faithful in doing Lyft and got shafted they can definitely kiss 💋 where the sun 🌞 doesn't shine.
George Washington,"Tolls never appear in the upfront fare, but get added later to the trip once it’s completed. Also, this chat you posted doesn’t show them declining to pay the toll."
George Washington,"I have a problem with Lyft, I drive in the Philly area and sometimes I have to take passengers to nj. There’s a five dollar toll to come back into PA so whenever I take someone to jersey Lyft has never paid for the toll to come back. Not to mention that PA Lyft drivers can’t drive in jersey so I get logged out of the app anyways"
George Washington,"Worst support in the entire world. I contacted them once about a toll for a ride because they paid me lower than the amount that was charged and support would not reimburse the 75¢ difference unless I had a receipt. I told them multiple times that the toll station did not give a receipt and showed them the charge on my credit card but they didn’t care. Uber happily reimburses the correct toll amount, so I don’t know why Lyft can’t. Is Lyft severely broke or something? Lmao"
George Washington,"I have found that Gr**yft** often does omit the tolls.  If I protest, it will add the toll.  I suspect that this is deliberate in hopes that many drivers will not notice it.  If you protest, it will pay, but, it relies on large numbers of drivers' not protesting.  If one hundred drivers say nothing about a five dollar toll, that has to be close to two months electric bill at one of the few Hubs that is still open."
George Washington,I had rides in NJ and sometimes they would reimburse you for tolls and sometimes they wont. Lyft is such a scam they take 50%+ for rides sometimes even more if its a priority ride. Lyft sometimes would take 70-80% on some of the long rides as well. This company is a joke. We make Logan Green super rich while he sits on his ass and does absolutely nothing. Except making decisions on how to make more money and screw Lyft drivers over. I heard drivers getting murdered out there for $12 an hour after expenses and all Lyft does says we are sorry for your loss. Company is a joke. Thank god i do this part time. I feel bad for those who drive Lyft full time.
George Washington,I’m mainly Uber but I did drive Lyft in Philly for the Eagle’s playoffs . because Uber sent me out there but Lyft let me do pickups
George Washington,In MA  They snitch on drivers so the state adds an extra dollar to every toll
George Washington,They reembursed me $0.30 cents for a $1.25 toll 🫠
George Washington,"They never did.

Also taking people to the airport? They tell you to pay for the customer and NOT to ask the customer for money. DFW is the only place they charge you to get into the airport"
George Washington,"Threatening them with the ""gonna post this on social media"" fucking douchebag"
George Washington,Agreed I’ve been around for 3 years now lots of changes
George Washington,It doesn’t say anything about them not paying the toll plus you were being a dick from the get go to them- of course they’re not gonna want to help someone like that 🤷🏻‍♂️
George Washington,They've always reimbursed me.
George Washington,Yea they do unless driver specifies not to take toll and you do. The route will not take you on till in that case. They do not pay for express lanes though and they will tell you to take them. Which is pure bs
George Washington,Did you pay a cash toll or was it from a transponder?
George Washington,"In my market, tolls are only paid if you have a passenger in the car when you go through the plaza"
George Washington,I would keep escalating it
George Washington,Last time I paid a toll was 11 or 12 yrs ago.   Visiting Delaware. Luckily there are Zero toll roads where I live.
George Washington,They paid me a toll going in to New Jersey on the GW which doesn’t charge that way. 🤷🏻
George Washington,[deleted]
George Washington,"I recently had like 10$ in tolls on an hour long trip, (I usually drive Lyft 95 percent of the time). Anyways , Uber included like 1$ for toll on the fare , I reached out, and needless to say Uber was generous in making it right . Also had a psssnger make a mess recently w Uber, submitted a detailing invoice from a shop, Uber instantly covered it.
HOWEVER, when I asked lyft to cover a toll, they wouldn’t. Also submitted an invoice for a mess and they wouldn’t pay more than 20$ that they originally provided .. smh . Prob from all these bonusss they’re tapped, like here, take this money and leave us alone for anything else 😂"
George Washington,"https://transportation.gwu.edu/student-rates

Good luck - depending on your schedule, pre-COVID there were several ""$5 after 5 pm, cash only"" garages near campus."
George Washington,"DC has this great thing called ""slugging,"" where you can avoid paying for EZPass by carpooling with strangers- it's really effective and you can choose to drive or slug according to your schedule for the day :)

[http://www.slug-lines.com/](http://www.slug-lines.com/)"
George Washington,If your schedule allows for it try VRE or one of the commuter buses. During the non covid times that commute could easily be two hours one way by car. Source: I lived down there for a few years before moving back because it’s actually more expensive then the city.
George Washington,"Honestly, I think the public transit will be worth it both in terms of cost and in terms of fatigue. What everyone is saying here about parking is true. There is very limited 2 hour free spots you can sometimes snag but 9/10 times you'll need to pay. And you should expect to pay $20 for the day if you're doing daily parking. If you pay for hourly parking it's around $5 I think and you need to move your car every 2 hours. 

On the train you can do work and chill and it will save you the headache of traffic and/or the fatigue of driving. Back when I lived at the end of the blue line I would spend my metro time either working or relaxing. I second looking into the VRE."
George Washington,"If you want to park on campus in one of the GWU garages, it's something like $20 a day. I lived in Burke for a little while, and it was a little less than $200/mo to take the Springfield metro in with maybe a 20-minute drive to the train station. Plus $5 a day for parking to bring it to (conservatively) $300 a month for transportation. Plus, I didn't have to worry about being in traffic. I just got to read nice books during my commute, which is a plus. 

Compare that to $20/day parking on campus, or $400/mo. 

Of course, these calculations assume you're going in 5 days a week. If you're doing less than that it may be worth it to drive in, if you can handle 1.5-2hrs of traffic."
Louisville,"Should be fine, although you might have a slightly longer wait and higher fare"
Louisville,I made that mistake once and huge raise in surge pricing was unreasonable.
Louisville,"Something you may not have considered if you’re looking to cut down your transportation costs, I always take a TARC into town and Uber home."
Louisville,i would bike. can you rent an electric bike and lock it up?
Louisville,Can I hire you for oaks and derby weekend?
Louisville,"I drove Uber before the pandemic. Did it in a fullsize pickup to get us through about 3-4mo of a cash crunch as I changed jobs and we had a huge dip in income we weren't ready for.

Let me be 100% clear. It's BARELY a profitable job. You are trading your time and equity in your vehicle for cash in hand. The only way it works out where you make money is if you ignore the cost of purchase and insurance. If you negate those (because you already have the vehicle, and will have those expenses regardless of working), then I made \~$13-$15/hr. With places now hiring in that range for NOT driving, Uber becomes far less of a good deal. The only upside IMO is that you can log in/out as you see fit, and you don't have to adhere to a given schedule. 

 I only drove Fri-Sat-Sun nights from \~5pm to \~5am or so. Family was mostly sleeping or otherwise preocupied, so I was out making cash to keep the lights on while they slept. It worked for me, as I needed cashflow, not pure profits while I transitioned career positions.

If you're OK trading your time and vehicle for cashflow, sure it can work. If you want pure profits, it's not great. Let me know if you want more details, or a peek at my records for driving."
Louisville,Call any of the bourbon tourism companies. You can use their vehicles plus make tips!
Louisville,"Uber and Lyft you would be driving one or two people around, getting paid next to nothing after gas costs"
Louisville,"Why does Uber spam job boards advertising positions for teachers and professors, and all sorts of other occupations, then put the relevant info about looking for drivers further in the listing?"
Louisville,"A couple of things, information-wise:

Lyft has now updated their coverage map. A few weeks ago they took a giant slice out of the map, intending to just cut out the airport. Essentially, though, it cut out like probably 1/12 of the coverage area. they have now updated the map so that only the airport and a miniscule strip next to it is blocked. Lyft is still not allowed to pick up from the airport (drop-offs are fine), but if you are in that strip and need a ride, move the pin and text your driver the real address. Do not do this for the airport, we will be fined $100 if we are caught.

Also, Uber IS now allowing drivers to pick up from the airport. We may be fined, but Uber will now pay it!

Edit: I found out yesterday that the info I was given about uber being allowed to pick up from the airport was faulty. Please don't request from there until Uber/Lyft release statements saying that we can!"

Louisville,How many times has someone thrown up in your car? Ever been robbed?
Louisville,"Aside from the aesthetics of the interior of the vehicles, why should a potential consumer choose to use a private car service over a traditional taxi."
Louisville,"Do you all see a significant down trend in service in and around major holidays? I'm an economics student, so we like to examine things like this. I know that shock pricing is something Uber and Lyft use, but is there a significant decrease during those times, or is it steady?

Also, thanks for the man rides home from 4th Street and Bardstown Road. I just hope I've been entertaining in my drunken ramblings to you. "
Louisville,"Hey rideshare folks. I've been driving a taxi for about 7 years with great success and I welcome new competition. I do want to clear some things up, though, and hopefully contribute to the discussion in a positive way.

The controversy with Louisville International Airport exists because LIA *insists* on contracts and permits for all commercial transit operating out of the airport. Given that Lyft and Uber are both companies that pick up for pay at the airport, both companies should be subject to follow the letter of the law. It's not an unfair barrier to competition, as some people have tried to spin it. It's the way the airport's management works, and it will probably be resolved in 2015. I dislike them as much as anybody else, but it is what it is.

As for the existence of ridesharing companies, it seems kind of unusual to me that a vehicle which is dispatched to a location and paid by a third party who handles money would not be considered a taxi, even though said vehicle and driver performs essentially the same services. Again, I'm not knocking competition - it was badly needed to begin with - but it seems that both Uber and Lyft operate on models that ignore laws completely that pertain to the services they offer. You guys should at the very least be required to pay for Ground Transportation permits with the city and be subject to the same fees and vehicle inspections that taxi and limousine services are obligated to pay and fulfill. 

I hope I didn't come across as nasty. I actually considered working for either company myself, but I wanted to be able to keep driving my cab as well. For whatever reason, Lyft doesn't want to have vehicles markedly identifiable as taxis working with them, and Uber isn't offering UberTaxi here. No clue what's up with that. 

The vast majority of our fleet drivers have abandoned Yellow Cab and switched to Uber, as far as I can tell. Our numbers have significantly reduced and our lease rates have increased. It's not necessarily taxi drivers who have dug their heels in so much as the company, whom I wish had the foresight to lobby for UberTaxi in the first place instead of throwing money at state government for regulations that do little to nothing. However, I still manage to make between $600-$1000 a week depending on how hard I want to work and what's going on in town. In the long run - especially in the summer - I don't see very many Uber or Lyft drivers making enough money to make it a full time job, which is kind of disappointing. It's a great model, but the insurance snafus are enough to make me stay away. I prefer to transport regular clients and build a relationship with them and know that they're covered if we get in an accident.

Just out of curiosity though - and this is one of the things that stopped me from working for y'all - does your personal insurance carrier continue to cover you if they find out you were operating for Uber or Lyft in the case of a collision?"
Louisville,Would you rather Lyft one elephant-sized puppy or a hundred puppy-sized elephants?
Louisville,"OP (Adam), you live on my street. Pretty cool. I tried out for Lyft but was denied because I didn't have floor mats and there is an old oil spot that *will not come out no matter what* in the backseat. Oh well."
Louisville,"What would you say is the income difference from lyfting in May 2014 versus now?

I say this, because I was making about $40 an hour back in May and then around July all the free promos stopped, and ride prices decreased. This led less people to request lyfts, and paired with the fact that more and more drivers were added daily, it became scarse to get more than 1 lyft an hour. I quit being a lyft mentor (rip position) around July 2014 because it just wasn't worth my time and effort to make barely minimum wage."
Louisville,"I have been curious about this, are Lyft and Uber drivers allowed to pick up me and my dog? Would it be the driver's preference?

I assume service animals must be allowed?

Just curious!"
Louisville,[deleted]
Louisville,[deleted]
Louisville,I’d be surprised if someone even took that. They’d have to bank on getting a fare back to Louisville or eat the cost of gas/time on the way back.
Louisville,"You’re better off renting a car, most likely. I’d probably just park my car at Indy, assuming you have a vehicle."
Louisville,"You’d be better off paying a friend or family member gas money to take you, or renting a car. It’s unlikely a driver would even take the ride since they most likely would not make money on the way back."
Louisville,Are you asking how much the driver would make or how much you would pay?
Louisville,Schedule it in the app and see
Louisville,"Is your flight on a weekend? I visit family in Indy frequently on the weekends, would be down to drive you up for the price of gas. down to meet in public first for peace of mind as well.

dm if interested"
Louisville,Open the app and check yourself

Louisville,[deleted]
Louisville,"In the chances someone won't take you the full trip and you absolutely need to use a ride share service, I'd suggest booking a trip about halfway there and and then getting a second lyft to reach the actual destination."
Louisville,Prices are supply/demand based at the time of request and can vary wildly.  Rides to airports are usually more expensive.
Louisville,"Depends on what part of town. The more urban areas, airport, downtown, highlands etc it’s pretty well served, further out you’ll find it takes a bit longer to get rides."
Louisville,There aren't as many as there were pre-COVID but I haven't really had issue getting one except one time late at night I did have to wait like 25 minutes.
Louisville,It's there. The wait a bit higher than pre covid.
Louisville,We also have ZTrip here.
Louisville,"Between their shenanigans and Covid, drivership is way down everywhere except the big cities. You won’t have to trouble finding a ride most of the time, but you might late at night, etc."
Louisville,"Lyft/Uber isn’t how it once was, but I have had plenty of good experiences with taxis in this city"
Louisville,I've never had a problem getting an Uber or Lyft. Normally it's only about a 10 minute wait. If you are going to be in a less populated area it may take up to 30 minutes though.
Louisville,"It’s totally pandemic-related. (I’ve asked drivers in Lou about it as well, and that’s what they’ve all said.) The only time I’ve ever had a long wait for either has been since that started. Since I came back to the US in Nov, big cities are the only place I haven’t had a shit wait."
Louisville,Pandemic related. I never had an issue with Uber or lyft from the airport before last year.
Louisville,"Throwing my vote in for pandemic related as well. While I've never specifically gotten one from the airport me and my friends would commonly be using uber/lyft with nary a problem and wait times usually around 5 minutes. We lived in the Clifton area at the time.

At one point I lived out past 265 and was still able to get an uber/lyft when I wanted one. Granted wait times were longer but I expected as much"
Louisville,"The plus side is, if you want to be an uber/lift driver once you move here, there are probably openings."
Louisville,I've noticed I can still get rides but the wait to get them is longer. I wasn't sure why but the pandemic makes sense.
Louisville,Pandemic related.  I travel fairly often and usually you get a pickup at the airport within 5 minutes even later in the evening.  Out in the metro area it can be a 10-15 minute wait.  I Needed a Lyft at the airport last week and it was a 25 minute wait.  I went with a Lyft lux instead and they were there within 5 minutes
Louisville,"Definitely pandemic. Uber/Lyft has been my go-to for soccer games and drinking events without fail, there's just not a lot of demand until things are more fully re-opened."
Louisville,"It’s common, unfortunately. I moved from the Colorado mountains so I was used to Denver or Salt Lake City Lyft where they pick you up in 10 minutes and you never have to wait for someone to accept your ride. I’ve had to wait so long here I end up cancelling and driving during peak times."
Louisville,"Yeah. Pre-covid - pre-B Taylor protests - uber/lyft was spot on. I’m sure now that things have calmed down, vaccinations and more stuff opening and getting back to normal - ride shares will follow. Don’t lose hope or patience."
Louisville,Yeah that pretty normal it is KENTUCKY after all 🤣
Louisville,This issue is likely related to stimulus/Tax windfall - they otherwise are lined up.
Louisville,"Moved here from the DC area (NOVA technically), and while I do agree it's due to the pandemic, you're not gonna find the same number of cars as you will there. 

&#x200B;

I've had a couple of close calls and almost missed my flight, getting from my home(mellowood) to the airport. One was at 5 am, which I do understand. But a couple of them were at 3-5pm, No cars at all."
Louisville,Many of us Uber drivers are waiting on our annual background checks to be completed. I have been down for 6 weeks. Others have been down longer.
Louisville,"I used Uber on Halloween (well, Saturday actually) and got picked up on 6th Street within 5 minutes as late as 3:30 a.m. There was a bit of surge pricing around midnight. Can’t speak for how New Year’s will be but just sharing my experience."
Louisville,"For NYE yes, easily. Expect to pay a pretty penny."
Louisville,I just got an Uber at about midnight. $57 from the airport to J Town though.
Louisville,"Never had a problem. Plus there are plenty of cab companies.

Bars stay open until 4 am."
Louisville,Left bar Halloween night at 3 am. Uber picked me up within 4 minutes. Was off main st downtown.
Louisville,"I work in a hotel and I can say without a doubt, no. Had issues this past Sunday because it was Halloween. They would not schedule my guest a ride because the demand was so high. I would imagine it's gonna be even worse for New Year's Eve."
Louisville,"It’ll be pretty expensive and There might be longer wait times, but if you’re willing to pay the surge pricing and wait for a ride you should be able to get some thing."
Louisville,"Usually, but very expensive."
Louisville,Got picked up at 4 a.m. in the middle of an ice storm once. That was pre-pandemic though :/
Louisville,I can’t see why not but I’m sure it’ll be surge pricing. Wait time will depend on if you’re heading into the party areas or leaving. I got picked up at 11:30pm and then again at like 3:30am Saturday night no problem and there were tons of people coming and going all night.
Louisville,I’ve caught of rides around 2am. The area is a favorite. If your inside the 264 loop it shouldn’t be a problem.
Louisville,"During any holiday or weekend night, yes. On random week nights it is hard to get one in between those times. I have driven for both and use both frequently."
Louisville,Middle of last week i got picked up around 1 from the hospitals downtown.
Louisville,Insane expensive at that time.
Louisville,Nope. I wouldn’t bank on it.
Louisville,No because it tends to fluctuate
Louisville,Nope... scheduled a Uber 3 days in advance to drop me off at the airport and they cancelled 2 hours before my flight.
Louisville,No.
Louisville,No
Louisville,"Funny. From like Feb to May I drove a taxi, and I might've seen one or two at night, but I usually never saw an uber or lyft till like 6/7am. Some nights I thought I was the only taxi out."
Louisville,It's the same way in *insert name of City here*
Louisville,That calender is bullshit. Mine says I'll make $5/hour and I always make at least $20 even on a dead night like Wednesday.
Louisville,What is this projection calendar and where can I find it?
Louisville,I guess lyft is dropping the price of getting a ride to reflect the cost. 
Louisville,"Got an Uber to Cincinnati about a year ago for about $120-$130 from the Louisville Greyhound station after my bus was canceled at the last minute.. and already had paid for concert tickets that night, and a hotel reservation and of course didn't want to miss the concert.. I know we lucked out, but I contacted Uber and within literally 5 minutes one showed up and took us straight to our hotel in Cincy. I was still getting a refund on my Greyhound ticket when they showed up that fast .. When the driver got to Greyhound station, he asked where we're going even though I had entered Cincy as my destination . I said Cincinnati. He seemed surprised but just said okay and we were on our way. So we got dropped off at our hotel as opposed to having to find our way from the Greyhound station in Cincinnati. I was surprised it was that inexpensive for that one way trip.. I can't say how much they would charge you now.. Of course we gave them a generous  tip. Split the charge with my buddy so even though we had to pay extra at least we made the concert. If this had been a few years ago before Uber or Lyft we would have been fucked. I would imagine it would cost more now but at least we had that option and it really saved the day all things considered."
Louisville,The driver will have to drive home all those miles empty as they probably can't drive in another market. Consider a sizeable tip.
Louisville,"Had a coworker that managed to get an Uber to Indy last year, cost about $150 + generous tip.

He was in for meetings and a wave of flight cancellations was going to strand him for a few days, booked another flight ASAP and got a pickup from SDF straight to IND.

Alternatively, you might find someone on the sub that would be up for an adventure!"
Louisville,[deleted]
Louisville,"I’m not a driver, but I’ve had a driver tell me to request the ride in advance because they can see the pick up and drop off. I do not know this for certain.  

When I request long hauls last min I always text the driver who accepts so they can cancel if they do not want to do a longer ride."
Louisville,Flight attendants do it all the time
Louisville,A one way car rental could be an option
Louisville,I’m a driver. Chat request sent.
Louisville,"Hi! I just read your post as I was searching for the exact same thing. Would you mind sharing how you decided to make it to Indy and how much it cost? I have to catch a flight up there, but I live in Louisville. No direct flights from here for the times I needed, ugh. I've heard people paying drivers cash but I don't know how safe that would be you know? Everything is so expensive!!"
Louisville,You should have no issue.
Louisville,I've found leaving the airport is very easy with lots of availability. Getting to the airport at odd hours though can be a bit dicey.
Louisville,"Yes but be aware the lyfts/ubers are stationed at a separate parking lot (not too far from normal passenger pickup — if you’re coming down the escalator, towards the left)."
Louisville,"As long as there are flights coming in, there are ride share drivers available. While you are waiting for your bags to come out on the belt, request your ride. Neither of you (you or the driver) will have much of a wait if you do it then."
Louisville,"A cab will cost around 20/25 dollars from the airport to downtown. There's always a que of them waiting outside, you shouldn't have a problem getting one."
Vanderbilt,"VSG has Lyft codes for rides to and from Nashville’s airport before and after the academic breaks. I’m not sure if it’s for every academic break or even if it’s still operational, but [here’s](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWJcxkGr8H_/?utm_medium=copy_link) an Instagram post about it. It also had codes for rides to and from destinations offering the COVID vaccine earlier in the pandemic ([Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnWRlLBDka/?utm_medium=copy_link)). I don’t think there’s a general Lyft discount fund, but interestingly, there [used to be](https://vanderbilthustler.com/15749/featured/vsg-announces-uber-campus-pass-opportunity/) Uber discounts [and](https://vanderbilthustler.com/17213/featured/uber-taken-off-commodore-card-and-replaced-with-lyft-credits/) Commodore Card credits for Lyft."
Vanderbilt,I looked through my email and noticed they hadn't sent out any VSG Shuttle info this year—the previous notices were all sent out by former VSG presidents from past years. Maybe they nixed the program after all.
Vanderbilt,"The student government used to have a shuttle to the airport but it was so unreliable. I think they got rid of it a few years ago. You'll learn once you get here how useless the student government is. 

As far as getting to/from the airport just take an Uber. If you split it or take UberPOOL it should be less than $10. Plus you don't have to deal with the rude Nashville cab drivers who can't speak English and get lost on purpose."
Vanderbilt,"Are you a current student at Vanderbilt or in high school? First, I’d say that Vanderbilt is a new money school. Second, at any top 15 school in the US there will always be students that come from wealthy backgrounds, don’t let that deter you from pursuing your dreams. Lastly, I doubt that you will have a hard time finding friends. Students here at Vanderbilt are very nice and you will definitely be able to find your group at some point."
Vanderbilt,"The wealthy kids aren’t explicitly mean, a lot of them are really nice. I actually found that we ended up not really being in the same circles anyways - friendly if we lived next to each other or same org, but I wasn’t really interacting a ton with the elite.

That being said, as both low income and first generation I did feel isolated, lonely, and like a poor piece of shit sometimes when everyone could party all the time and go on vacations even just for a weekend trip. I feel like I missed out on a lot of opportunities just because of money. But my high school situation was similar so I was used to it.

I feel like it’s gonna be like that at most top schools - probably the worst at the very top and Ivy, still rough for T20 or so, and still pretty rough for most majorly recognized universities. There’s gonna be that divide. 

So, I don’t think being low income means you shouldn’t go here. 1) They offer great aid which is why I attended and 2) You can be resourceful and do fun stuff without money like I did. You might struggle in something like Greek Life because it’s hella expensive both with official dues and with the expectations for formals. But you can do things like Alternative Spring Break and talk to the treasurer about your financial situation to go somewhere for FREE, do volunteer work, meet cool people, have a blast. Just keep looking out for resources and opportunities because there ARE fun things you can do for free."
Vanderbilt,"There’s enough of a mix of people that you won’t feel totally isolated, but there will be moments where you might be left out. For example, when I studied abroad most of my group went on weekend trips every week, staying in hotels and traveling around the country. I couldn’t even afford to go to a cafe with them most days, much less travel. 

But there is so much fun to be had on campus that doesn’t cost you a dime, I really spent time making my own fun and bringing other students along and it was a blast. There are lots of down to earth people too, hang out with the multicultural groups and McGill for nice diverse and unfussy friendships. Greek life is a magnet for the rich douche element"
Vanderbilt,"I think the biggest thing is to just embrace being a student at Vandy. Dress well and smile and nod (and fake it til you make it). I’ve heard things have gotten more academically focused since I was there, but, you know, I’d have 1 beer while I was out versus five cocktails. 

I also found that a fair number of the old (and new) money people to be extremely friendly and welcoming of everyone. Obviously not everyone—but I went on a private jet to a football game one year because my friend’s dad was going and he invited us along. You may not have access to your own yacht or beach house, but as long as you help with gas, you’re invited. 

The only people I know who didn’t like Vandy were those who decided they were going to be miserable.

Vandy also had a lot of programs for poor kids to help pay for things like spring break and Maymester etc."
Vanderbilt,"FGLI grad here. There are gonna be some major side eye moments, but there will also be people from similar backgrounds or who are at least like-minded.

In my experience, wealthy kids at Vandy aren't outright mean to low and middle class students, but some will prefer not to associate with them. You'll come to appreciate this.

A few things that might help OP or others:

1. On campus, things mostly even out across income levels. It's the off campus experiences (exploring Nashville, vacations, eating out) that are divided.
2. Classmates and even professors will say dumb shit about money and class. You don't have to correct them. Especially in my Peabody classes, I felt like I had to be the spokesperson for the poors, but that's not my (or your) job.
3. Scarcity mindset will tell you otherwise, but meal money is there for you to use. You don't have to carefully ration.
4. QuestBridge and other first gen orgs on campus are amazing, even just to get a read on what other orgs are like for FGLI students.

Feel free to DM if you like. Always happy to help."
Vanderbilt,"I think you'll be fine, and better off for it, as long as you know you'll be okay ocasionally sitting things out. The city bus is free with the student card, by the way, which is actually something I think most people don't know but that can be very useful when you want to get around and don't need/want to call a Lyft."
Vanderbilt,"You might not be getting blackout drunk on Broadway every Friday or telling people about your vacay to Switzerland during the three day fall break but you’ll be okay. Money is great to have but there’s so many fun things to do on campus and in the area that are free/relatively cheap. Orgs are really diverse and fun. The bus is free and despite other peoples complaints, it’s not really that bad most of the time. Greek life is where the rich gang tend to hang out and in general it’s insanely expensive both formally and informally, not to mention the many social problems with Greek life. You’ll be okay! It’s an amazing school with people from many walks of life and the aid is really good if you’re from the mid-lower end of middle class/poor."
Vanderbilt,I was feeling the exact same way as OP considering I come from a Hispanic low income household from an underfunded public school 😭 but the comments definitely helped me ease my worries!
Vanderbilt,"Was able to successfully do it a few weeks ago, maybe even earlier than 6. I just scheduled it in advance and had no issues."
Vanderbilt,I have never had a problem with a scheduled ride. Had one on Thursday and the driver was at my place at 5:10 am.
Vanderbilt,You shouldn’t have a problem getting a ride. I’ve done it multiple times. A lot of drivers like the morning shifts driving to the airport
Vanderbilt,"Same here, I’ve scheduled Lyfts to BNA as early as 5:30am with no problem. That said, I’ve worried about it every time.

EDIT: typo"
Vanderbilt,Got one at 4am a few weeks ago
Vanderbilt,Pickup at 6AM is usually fine. What side of town though?
Vanderbilt,Have had scheduled rides cancelled coming from Bellevue. No prior warning until pick up time. Multiple times.
Vanderbilt,Yes
Vanderbilt,"Done it a bunch before 5. Sometimes scheduled, sometimes not. Usually cheaper to not schedule and I havent had issues."
Vanderbilt,"Worked for a client in New Mexico for nine months, traveling there Monday though Friday. Every Monday morning I had Uber or Lyft pick me up in B-wood at 4:00am, without failure."
Vanderbilt,What day?
Vanderbilt,"Had zero problems when I lived in East, have had a lot of problems since I moved to Brentwood. Always cancel."
Vanderbilt,"I took an uber from Mt. Juliet to BNA last month at 7 am with no problems. I overheard the driver on the phone say how she had a couple rides before mine, too"
Vanderbilt,Schedule ahead or schedule a taxi if you're really worried.
Vanderbilt,"Vandy isn't going to hold you back in any way, but it isn't a feeder to type A companies (Berkeley is). Those companies usually want graduate students from top CS schools anyway, though, so if that's truly your dream it won't matter; you'll go on to grad school at a target. 

You can still network and try to break into a prop shop as an undergrad, but it's very difficult no matter what school you go to and you usually won't end up working as a quant. 

Contrary to popular belief prestige has the least importance for FAANG/Big N, which have enough money to send recruiters to a wide variety of schools. Prestige and location matter more for smaller companies.

It's really not necessary to take out loans for Princeton/Harvard/MIT when you have a full ride to Vandy and admissions to UCLA/UCB to choose from."
Vanderbilt,"Berkeley CS > UCLA > Vandy

But know this, at the end of the day, 90% of what you learn in classes is pretty much the same across most colleges (SJSU, berkeley, UIUC, etc) , because the core course content is usually the same. The biggest difference you'll actually see is a) the research and b) the recruitment. For both of these things berkeley is the best - proximity to the bay + long legacy of pioneering computing research is amazing - many of the internet's standards were invented at berkeley. Again, if all you care about is getting the actual job itself, it mostly doesn't matter, applications are online anyways. 

From what you've written in your post in terms of your goals, I would strongly recommend vandy if you have a full ride -- you'll save your parents a lot of money, will likely have smaller class sizes (less crowding than UC schools) and will still be able to get into FAANG/Quant trading. If you're interested in research, I would recommend Berkeley or UCLA.

One more thing: most employers dont care much where you went to school (or in some cases, if you even went to school), as long as its a semi decent accredited university. They care more about your actual CS skills."
Vanderbilt,Go to vandy and don't look back
Vanderbilt,"Vanderbilt is a great school and companies like Lyft and Two Sigma have been known to take people from there, so I doubt it would hold you back. In addition, Vanderbilt isn't as well known for CS in comparison to Berkeley, so you'd probably be able to stand out. However, if you are very confident in your skills in CS and Math, I would strongly recommend going to Berkeley. The competition will be more intense, but the Berkeley CS namebrand will help you in the long run when it comes to grad schools (and obviously going to berkeley itself for grad school). Best of luck!"
Vanderbilt,"Can't say for A (quant) but for big tech I don't think your school name is as important as other people make it out to be. I go to GT, (pretty solid CS school, have specific recruitment. Amazon likes to hire from us). GT definitely has useful resources for FAANG/big tech such as the career fair, but there are ways to get around this. Referrals imo are the most useful thing. Getting a referral to a big Tech basically gives you an interview, as long as your resume is decent (got an internship/good side project). If you have a referral to Amazon (for example) but go to a community college (no shame to community college goers, just using this as an example), the odds of you getting an interview with Amazon are probably higher than that of someone that goes to a target CS school (ivy-tier, berkeley, etc etc) but doesn't have a referral, given the exact same resume (same projects, internships).

&#x200B;

In this regard, go to the school that A. you want to go to B. can afford. The one thing I will say is that going to GT, I've realized I can get referrals from friends that interned at such big companies. This is the only advantage that a school like GT/Michigan/Berkeley can give you I think. Because there are so many CS majors at those schools (GT is like 20%), the odds of making a friend that interned/Full time at a big tech is super frickin high. (I honestly think it might be easier to get into FAANG from these schools rather than ivies, just because the tier of school is basically negligible since they are both solid, but the public schools are massive and you can network v well especially if you are social).

&#x200B;

Regardless, I think it comes down to building a network. Some schools may be easier to network into FAANG than others. However, if you want to go to a smaller school for other reasons (prestige, environment, pricing, whatever), you can still network in other ways. Just my 2 cents.

&#x200B;

Anyway I completely disregarded the quant firms because I have 0 experience in applying in those places so I dont think my info is accurate, but from what I hear Harvard (ivies in general) will prepare you better for those than big public schools. (I dont know many people from GT that work in fintech/quant, or people who are even interested in them tbh).

&#x200B;

Edit: Can't believe I forgot to say this but congrats full-ride to Vandy, that's awesome."

Vanderbilt,Vandy>>>>
Vanderbilt,"Most of the world: We are hungry. Please help us. 

This guy: 
>My parents have around 120k saved up."
Vanderbilt,There’s nothing you could get at Berkeley / UCLA that you couldn’t get at Vandy. HYPSM certainly offer their own special class of advantages that I’d argue are always worth it especially since like you said you’re interested in startups
Vanderbilt,You can ride the city busses for free with your Vandy ID. That's a significant transportation perk.
Vanderbilt,"Thirty years ago my Vanderbilt stipend was $1000 a month.

I lived a block across Blakemore from campus for $300/mo.

Do better, Vandy.

"
Vanderbilt,"Also, babysit/tutor on the side. "
Vanderbilt,A lot of people will suggest driving for lyft or uber. I understand that inviting strangers into your car (often drunk ones) can be a less than savory experience. That's why I drive for grubhub. No risk of unruly people getting in my vehicle just great smelling food.
Vanderbilt,Work your butt off between now and then. If you can supplement a couple of hundred a month from savings that's a 20% increase in life. 
Vanderbilt,"$1000 a month is really pushing it. I would echo what the earlier poster said, and look to sublet an apartment in Bellevue near Highway 70, because a bus line goes right through, and it's free for Vandy.  Living near the campus is all but impossible in today's market.  I would leave the car at home, since the mileage you put on it reduces value, have to pay for gas (as minimal as that is with a Prius) and then deal with traffic everyday near West End.  

From personal experience when I first moved there, Craigslist and LetGo (it's available now, wasn't back then) are good options for furnishing the apartment on the cheap.  A decent amount of apartments have gym facilities (limited as they may be, saves money).  

I'm not sure about Lyft or Uber because you have a busy schedule, so you can't really make much money unless you are available at peak times, or get lucky quite often.   I'm not sure what your abilities and availabilities are, so I can't really suggest jobs without it being total shots in the dark.  

Good luck."
Vanderbilt,"There's a Piggly Wiggly across West End that's probably the cheapest market within walking distance.   If you have transportation, there's an Aldi's on Charlotte Pike with good prices.  K&S World Market (also on Charlotte) also has good prices.   An Instant Pot will help you cook a lot of good, inexpensive meals.

Vandy has a lot of departments, with a lot of activities.   I can't speak about Vandy, but at WFU, the physics department would have free snacks before the weekly colloquium.   If you can find departments having talks on different days of the week, you can eat free and save money.

When you need free/cheap things to do for fun (and you'll need to blow off steam in grad school, trust me), try some local Meetup groups.

If you need to furnish your room cheaply, there are several Goodwills and other consignment shops around.  

As they have mentioned, the parking situation at Vandy is pretty bad.  I started work January 2, no one at the office except me and my new boss.   I parked in a football field-sized completely empty parking lot, walked into the building, got a parking pass from my boss, walked out to put it on my dashboard (total elapsed time ~5 minutes), and the fuckers had already given me a ticket and wouldn't be denied their sweet ticket lucre.   For that reason alone, as well as saving gas, insurance, parking, you may want to use a bike instead.

On the flip side, Nashville real estate is completely bonkers and detached from reality, and $1000 is barely going to cover rent near Vandy.   If you do have a car, the farther away you can live, the more money you'll save.  I bought a 3400 sq ft house in Ashland City on 5 acres back in 2004, and paying off the mortgage in 10 years was cheaper than renting an apartment in Nashville nowadays.   "
Vanderbilt,Drive for lyft or uber if you have a car 
Vanderbilt,"Regarding the food stamps, haven't been on them in Nashville, but last I check main FM does not do double food stamps but pop up FMs do. 

Also avoid parking at VU parking is 40 a month. For staff at least."
Vanderbilt,If vandy doesnt help witg housing you are gonna have to live on the edge of town 
Vanderbilt,"I'm not even sure that is possible, without doing some type of additional work to make money. "
Vanderbilt,I understand.  I just got an assistantship at Vanderbilt for this year so I've been looking at rent prices and have been horrified. I really want to live close to campus but rent appears to be 1600 for a one bedroom and even then I'm worried I'll have to start it a month or two in advance just to be sure I'll have it in August :( 
Vanderbilt,Are you going to Peabody?  I think I had the exact same assistantship as you!  I live right across from campus and have made it work for 2 years. Feel free to PM me and I can give you details.  
Vanderbilt,"I would seriously double check that food stamp thing. I tried it when I was a student and was denied for well, being a student. If being poor while a student made you eligible for food stamps every kid in America would get them.  I could be wrong however, that was just my experience."
Vanderbilt,"Your income will not support your expenditures. You will be going into debt. You may wish to drive for uber or tutor or get a side job as you suggest, but I might just tell you that I would reckon that you'd walk away with debt. Depending on the degree, that could be good.

The richland park farmers market will take foodstamps, as will many vendors at the downtown farmers market. "
Vanderbilt,"I don't know what masters program you are doing, but I did one a few years ago at Peabody that included a 20hr per week assistantship that paid similarly poor. My experience was that the assistantship did not require anywhere near 20 hours a week to do the work, and so that was great time to do studying, reading, classwork. Also in my experience, the classes were fairly easy. There was ample free time. I could have easily worked a part time job if I'd wanted to. Finding something that fits with your class schedule, which will change each semester, might be tricky, but there are LOTS of  part time jobs in Nashville, especially in the service industry. With no outside income, I think you will find it INCREDIBLY difficult to live on $1,000 a month in Nashville and be happy. Especially if you want to be anywhere near campus. Just my 2 cents."
Vanderbilt,"I just bought 25 quarts of kidney beans from Habitat for Humanity Restore for like $30. That's like a months worth of food, but I don't know if life is worth living on only kidney beans. My point is don't starve or sacrifice healthy food just because you're on a tight budget. You can totally manage if you're creative and check out Farmers markets, thrift stores, freecycle, Habitat for Humanity, Aldi, and even the manager's special racks at Kroger (go early in the morning). And if it gets too the point where you're desperate don't be afraid to ask for help from DINKS who were in your exact position 5-10 years ago and can now afford to buy 25 quarts of kidney beans on impulse while shopping for a new sofa."
Vanderbilt,"It'll be tough.  When I was getting my phd some of my colleagues were on roughly $1100 and they made it work, but the lifestyle was spartan to say the least.  

It can be done, but qualifying for some assistance will help.  

I'm surprised they have funded masters programs.  What field?   "
Vanderbilt,Hey I'm a grad student at vandy too! What are you studying?
Vanderbilt,"People definitely survive on $12k/yr, but not easily. 

Consider thinking about ways to supplement your income: driving for lyft, tutoring students, even pick up an evening shift at a bar or restaurant. 

I don't know what kinds of hour requirements the assistantship has, but presumably it's 20 hrs per week, so you'll likely have enough free time to pick up a side hustle if you want. 

Nashville's housing market is pretty hairy especially near campus. Consider finding roommates who are also in grad school so you can split the cost of a parking pass, or take the bus. "
Vanderbilt,[deleted]
Vanderbilt,"Much appreciated. The car won't be in my name (borrowing from my folks) so that may pose a problem, not sure. "
Vanderbilt,"start selling drugs,  uber or something. Goodluck with the $1000 a month thing"
Vanderbilt,"If I gave you 500 for a ride, can you get me a kickback for 250?"
Vanderbilt,"I work for Lyft and love Nashville, so just wanted to spread the love. The $500 expires in 2 weeks so the sooner you can start using it, the better. "
Vanderbilt,I was interested until I found out that I had to use Facebook to log in. No thanks.
Vanderbilt,"I signed up and have used it twice. It was a pretty sweet process. Thumbs up on a cool new idea.

Both of my cars showed up under 5 minutes. Let's hope that's a feature that lasts!"
Vanderbilt,I was interested until I saw that I have to have facebook.  That's a show stopper.
Vanderbilt,[deleted]
Vanderbilt,Facebook login is required.  I'll wait for Uber.  
Vanderbilt,Is this any different than a taxi?
Vanderbilt,"Used the app last night and this morning to go to work because I didn't feel like cleaning off my car. Both drivers arrived in 4 minutes and were extremely friendly. In the email receipt it shows your credit being applied. You can also see how much of your credit you've used in the ""Payment"" tab in the menu."
Vanderbilt,"tried to use this a few days ago but couldn't. when i tried to request a lyft all the app gives me is the message ""lyft is available in the greater nashville area"". after some searching on the web for the nashville coverage i figured out it was telling me that service wasn't available in my area. i only live 13 miles from the center of downtown. 

1) it's a pretty ambiguous error message.
2) their definition of ""the greater nashville area"" is way out of line with what anyone who is from here would think that means. 

was very annoyed i went through the act of putting in my credit card number and my facebook account only to find out no service at my house. "
Vanderbilt,I can't seem to get it to work. I want a ride. :(
Vanderbilt,only three cars out right now
Vanderbilt,Sooo...I don't see how to get a $500 credit?
Vanderbilt,"Had a good first experience with Lyft this morning.  My driver was super nice (even offered refreshments.) When I got the receipt, I saw that it used the credit (though it looked like it was going to charge to my card during the donation process.

Normally I'm a bit annoyed by facebook logins -- but in this case, I suspect it's being used as a measure to protect the driver (i.e., they know who you are if you turn out to be crazy.)"
Vanderbilt,"So I installed the app signed in with fb, but I'm not seeing the Credit, was this something that was just for Monday?"
Vanderbilt,[deleted]
Vanderbilt,"I lived car free for many years here and commuted year round. It’s entirely feasible to do as long as you’re willing to buy the correct gear for the rain and the lights for riding at night. The hardest part is if you’re trying to look presentable after riding in the summer but with the advent of ride shares and scooters this shouldn’t be an issue. 


Feel free to message if you have any questions. Good luck with your studies."
Vanderbilt,"If you want to do anything in Nashville outside of the Vandy area, you'll need a car. Unless you plan to Uber everywhere."
Vanderbilt,"I do exactly that - I live about a mile from VUMC and walk every day. I could bike, which cuts my commute down to about 10 min. That area is relatively flat, so biking is easy.

But that's just for my daily commute. This city isn't easy to navigate without a car, and I have a huge disdain for companies like Uber and Lyft, so I opted to keep my car. I really only drive it like once a week, but it would be difficult and expensive if I needed some other mode of transportation to bop around."
Vanderbilt,Look into ZipCar and see if that will work for your car needs. Its a small fee to rent a car by the hour. I know they have them on the VU campus.
Vanderbilt,"I’m also here for school and did my first year living around Centennial Park without a car. Luckily my roommate had a car, so we always did our grocery shopping together, which would be the biggest reason to have a vehicle. Biking onto campus is quite a breeze and even walking to it too with all the housing nearby. 
That said, you’ll not see so much of Nashville and surrounding TN and all the beauty it has to offer: Percy Priest Lake, Percy and Edwin Warner Parks, Preservation Park, Beaman Park, Bells Bend, (you can still bike to Shelby Bottoms). Personally I have found this to be a much more fun city to live in since bringing my vehicle with me, but two years without it also would have been very doable (and cheap!!)."
Vanderbilt,"I am a Vandy grad who loves the outdoors, also from the North. Few things based on your post and comments: 

1. There's apartments and rentals near the medical campus, so you can easily manage a sub-30 commute. However, if there will be times you need to arrive ASAP and not have a ~30 minute window, it may be exhausting unless you look at a few units that are immediately adjacent to campus. 

2. I get you're from Minnesota, but Nashville does indeed have a winter and the occasional sucky weather. Both snowfall and storms (including extreme thunderstorms) roll through, so consider that factor- though that can probably be nullified if you have the budget to uber, which is around 24/7 in Nashville. 

3. If you want to get out to hikes, you **will** need a car. 

4. Vandy has an outdoor club called WillSkills which grad students can participate in. Be sure to check it out if you have the time. There's also an excellent gym on campus.

5. Last I checked, there's no good grocery stores that are by the medical center or the super adjacent apartments. I have no knowledge of the bus routes. There is a Piggly Wiggly off West-End, but it's the opposite side of campus (near the stadiums)."
Vanderbilt,"I did four years without a car living about 1.5 miles from VUMC and it was doable for day to day life. Another thing to remember is that there are VUMC shuttles that run from 6AM-6PM that go between different locations of VUMC and different parking lots/garages. If you manage to live in a place that's on one of the routes then that also is an option for getting around fairly quickly, though you need to learn the schedules. [https://www.vumc.org/medcenterparking/15947](https://www.vumc.org/medcenterparking/15947).

Once I did get a car, it really really made life a lot easier. For the four years that I didn't have a car I considered Nashville a difficult city to live in and kept looking for an exit. Once I got a car, even with traffic etc., my whole opinion of the city changed. I am generally not a car person, and I prefer walking and public transportation if I can use it, but Nashville is just not designed for that life. If you want to come to Nashville and enjoy Nashville, a car is a way to go. If you just want to get through and live your life and move on to the next step, you can totally get by without one."
Vanderbilt,"Hey there - I've not had car for 7 years and bike everywhere. I live in east and work in midtown, it's entirely doable and city has gotten WAY more bike friendly over the years. If it rains take Lyft and the bus is a good option too if you're near a stop. Somebody else mentioned the humidity in the summer and that's totally true in regard to getting sweaty but sounds like that won't impact you in your workplace."
Vanderbilt,"It is 100% doable in this neighborhood. My husband went car-less while a student at Vandy and would just bike everywhere, to the grocery store, the liquor store, restaurants, coffee shops, even downtown to meet up with me for Preds games. As others have mentioned be prepared for the weather, springtime is rainy and in summer the humidity is oppressive."
Vanderbilt,"Honestly, no unless you don’t expect to ever leave campus and can get stuff delivered"
Vanderbilt,"It's doable. If you can swing slightly higher rent and/or a roommate, consider renting at the Grove. 30 minute walk or easy bike ride to vandy, $10 ride share or less if needed."
Vanderbilt,"I live right in that area and really only use my car to get groceries.  Everything else is definitely walkable/bikable. It's a less than 2 mile walk to get to downtown for major events and there are a ton of restaurants and bars around if you're into that kind of thing.

As others have mentioned, you can Uber/Lyft if needed and the groceries have great delivery service."
Vanderbilt,"My advice is that given your living distance, are you ok with possible having to run/walk/bike in the dark and rain/snow/ bad weather in order to get to VUMC in time.

Gym wise you get perks about going into VU’s gym."
Vanderbilt,"They don't call it the Vanderbubble for nothing.

As long as you live very close to campus in Hillsboro Village or West End between Centennial Park and 21st, you'll find you can have most of your needs met within a 10 block walk."
Vanderbilt,"I worked at Vandy and lived in West End or downtown for five years. It’s very doable, especially if you prioritize getting an apartment on the 5 or 7 bus routes. They run all the time down West End Ave. It’s maybe the most walkable part of Nashville, biggest downside is lack of groceries in walking distance. With Publix in Capitol North it’s better."
Vanderbilt,[deleted]
Vanderbilt,"it can work decently well depending on where you live. If you live along one of the main route bus lines, its decently easy to get almost anywhere you would need to go in terms of basic needs/necessities, etc. and most things you might want would be somewhat near you in that area."
Vanderbilt,"Absolutely. It is doable, but there will be struggles. Sounds like the cold & rain will be no problem for you. But the summers will be hot & humid on a bike. Biking infrastructure is lacking in most places even on campus. If you can stay due South of campus or close to Belmont's campus, you would be biking on ""somewhat"" quieter streets that can connect to bike lanes on 24 Ave S leading to campus. There's quite a bit of student housing between Blair & Fairfax as well as be close to a grocery store on 21st & Blair."
Vanderbilt,"Totally doable. Groceries may be your biggest challenge, but you can always do delivery, plus you will meet plenty of classmates with cars."
Vanderbilt,"Actually the car i have now is worth more than what I bought it for. That's why I was thinking about selling. Not a normal situation, I know. Cars are typically horrible investments."
Vanderbilt,"Between the bike and the bus (which I used a lot pre-COVID) you could easily make it work for all the essentials - especially if you live near the Vandy campus. But you'll lose access to a lot of the parks around the city and neither will be a good option to go cross town.  

Nashville doesn't have a great bike infrastructure, has some big hills, and has some surface roads; like Charlotte, Gallatin, and West End that are probably too wide and fast to bike comfortably on. 

You may only need the car only once a week or so but it's hard to go without one in Nashville."
Vanderbilt,"I did 12yrs without a car. It was easy bike/bus/Lyft.

I’ve since moved 20 miles outside of town.

I really miss my bike."
Vanderbilt,You could use the Lyft rental program
Vanderbilt,"Completely.. and transportation outside your zone to water can be arranged in minutes, since I know you’ll want to be ice fishing."
Vanderbilt,"Literally the one part of town that’s flat, you could even use a fixie if you wanted to"
Vanderbilt,"Not really, no. If you only go to work and never go anywhere else, you could do it, but you’ll be looking at other expenses (food/grocery deliveries/Uber) instead of the car expense. Nashville is also pretty dangerous for pedestrians and bikers, in general. The city bus system is not great, usable, but really not great. I would under no circumstances recommend Nashville without a car."
Vanderbilt,"I think it would if you live in the area. Nashville has pretty limited public transportation compared to other cities of its size. If you do grocery delivery instead of shopping, you could do it."
Vanderbilt,"Theirs a lot of cheap cars for sale around, a lot of cars for under 10gs"
Vanderbilt,I believe Vandy will give you a bus card good for unlimited trips and transfers.  I had some friends who managed nicely without a car.
Vanderbilt,"NYC transplant. Still don’t have a car. My GF leases one and I’ll drive it on weekends, else I love Lyft."
Vanderbilt,"Believe specific to undergrade and specifically at one online college. 

On one end it seemed like a great deal but then on another side it seemed like it was just for English courses. 

I wonder if one person has ever got their Uber degree?"
Vanderbilt,"Yes, Undergrad.  You need 3000 rides and only need to maintain Gold status.  You can fall below acceptance/cancellation rate, you just need to get it back up again before the start of the next quarter.  Sign up and someone from ASU will call you within a week or two.  I'm two years into my Spanish degree. Great opportunity."
Vanderbilt,"Plus let's not forget the other  caveat, uber only pays after you exhaust all other financial aid."
Vanderbilt,"Knowing Uber, maybe community college. /s"
Vanderbilt,Its publicity stunt.
Vanderbilt,They'll deplatform you just before you get there.
Vanderbilt,Its ASU undergrad only
Duke,Usually yup. But also depends on time of day
Duke,I’d say easiest to get a ride mid to early afternoon
Duke,Do you have a car already or not?
Duke,I have a car but it's been in the shop for almost two months. Public transport on city buses has been surprisingly good so far
Duke,"If you have a car just keep it. 
1) Public transit in Durham is mediocre at best
2) You’re already used to the car lifestyle, making the adjustments under the stress of starting a demanding academic environment plus starting a new social circle will be tough 
3) You likely won’t be driving very much as the area is very compact, so I don’t think you’ll really even fit much from a hybrid (and charging could be problematic depending where you live)"
Duke,"Do you know where you will be living? I don’t have a car, and I get by pretty easily. The schedules are a little bit of a mess so you will have to plan. But it’s not all that gloom and doom"
Duke,"Don't do it. Duke is horrible in many ways, but parking is probably the worst. You will have to walk a mile or wait for an unreliable bus. I cannot wait to leave."
Duke,"What I did was 

1. Wear a Duke shirt
2. Find another person in a Duke shirt (which will be very easy if you come around move-in)
3. Introduce yourself and split the Uber

Good luck!!"
Duke,[deleted]
Duke,Durham Cab Co is often cheaper than Uber.
Duke,Uber
Duke,Welcome to the triangle area! Only way you get around is via ubers unless you have a car
Duke,There’s a website called MeYouRDU where you can look for airport carpools with Duke students
Duke,Uber or maybe RDU taxi service
Duke,https://meyourdu.com/ is a site that duke students use to split Ubers to and from RDU. If you have a lot of luggage make sure y’all request for an XL but otherwise this has been reliable.
Duke,+1 for hating having to have a car
Duke,"I just visited for ASW and while having a car would make it a lot easier, I think if you find an apartment near campus and a grocery store for essentials you should be okay. I took Uber’s around my entire weekend and most rides were less than $7 because things were close to campus. Also people were extremely kind so I’m sure you would not have a hard time finding rides if you are going to law school related things. Obviously I don’t live there so my experience is limited, but I would try connecting to other car less students to see how they would make it work! "
Duke,"I think you'd be okay with a bike, especially since the weather is so mild through the school year. As someone else said, get an apartment close enough to campus and grocery stores, and make friends with people with cars. Heck, if I end up attending, I'd be fine driving somebody to class with me. "
Duke,"Most current students at ASW said that while you can definitely live without one, having a car is a perk.

I'll be keeping my car if I end up at Duke, so y'all who need rides can definitely hit me up whenever."
Duke,"How to Deal Without a Car

1. Befriend people with cars.

&#x200B;

Seriously, I think you'll be fine as long as you make some friends and are willing to sometimes pay for gas. I wouldn't let this issue deter you from Duke. A bike will be perfectly fine most of the year."
Duke,"I live in Durham. I have a car, but I definitely think if you lived in the right area (AND you are used to and like that no car lifestyle) you could be fine without one. If you look at a map there’s kind of two Duke campuses, the law school is located on West Campus but near the East Campus there’s a lot of restaurants, grocery, etc. type stuff. I know more about East Campus because it’s closer to where I live. I believe there’s buses that run in between them as well. Check out the Bull City subreddit (sorry idk how to link) and people can help you out for sure. Sorry that’s a bit of a hodgepodge of info, but don’t stress!"
Duke,"Currently attending Duke as an undergrad, and can confirm that you can 100% make it without a car. You can even make it without a bike, although a bike is a lovely option in Spring (they're available on campus spots to rent for short periods if you don't want to buy, but I don't really know the details). There are quite a few apartment complexes close enough that you can walk or rely on Duke's bus system, and there is a free program called Duke Vans that will take you home in the evening/night as long as you're within a certain radius of campus. Getting downtown to go out is possible by buses and even walking, but you'll probably want to Uber/Lyft - both of which are always available. Instacart in your groceries and make friends with people who do have cars for airport rides, etc. You can do it!"
Duke,You could also consider leasing. Not like you'll be driving *that* much to worry about mileage limits.
Duke,[deleted]
Duke,"Duke freshman here. There is a place at duke for everyone. The frats do a lot but if you are introverted, then you aren’t gonna care about going out anyways. You’ll be able to find friends "
Duke,"This question pops up a *lot* in the subreddit from prospective students and I have no clue who the fuck keeps telling people that Duke has a social hierarchy and is a social mess (probably people that look at random statistics instead of actually going to Duke lol). I'm kinda tired and have work I really need to be doing so I'm just gonna paste a response I gave a month ago to another prospective ED Asian. You'll get the added benefit that I also talk a lot about what living at Duke/in Durham is like.


(Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/9khxkp/prospective_student/)

--------------------------------------

So I'm an introverted Asian dude, not greek- or SLG-affiliated, that's spent more than two years here and I'm 90% sure that whoever you talked to was heavily involved in Greek life (not saying it's bad, but I don't think his/her opinions really match what Duke is) so here are my insights:

Greek life presence at Duke is - I'm not quite sure how to put it - overstated? There are plenty of people in Greek organizations and SLGs but if you're not in those, they kinda just...exist. Last time the topic of Greek life creating a social hierarchy came up on this subreddit, the most popular response was something along the lines of ""I don't notice it"". It's probably more of an issue if you were actually in a greek organization, but you don't seem like the kind of person who wants to rush so I'd say it's a nonfactor.

Parties: I'd say most people are down to chill or have a house party or something similar. The frat parties are just the most boisterous and noticeable parties. I'm a junior and have yet to go to anything of that sort that wasn't just a small house party.

Social scene is healthy outside of greek life. Whoever told you that people tend to lose their first semester friends is kind of correct, but imo it doesn't have much to do with rush. You just meet so many people in the first few weeks of school that it's inevitable that you don't stay friends with all of them; I'd say that it's very unlikely that you lose an actual friend to the rush process.

Unsafe my ass. Durham's safe as long as you aren't alone late at night or you don't venture into Southeast Durham (which is both relatively far from campus and devoid of anything appealing). I leave my door unlocked and have never felt unsafe leaving stuff (e.g. my laptop) in a common room while I go grab dinner or whatever (I've gotten into more trouble for like claiming the entire table with my stuff while being gone for hours)

There's a decent amount of stuff to do; not like city-level but it's not the middle of nowhere. Okay yeah Durham doesn't have a particularly great Asian food scene (disclaimer: originally from California so my standards are kinda high for this) but it's not like barren in terms of Asian food. The food scene in general though is great.

Note that if you or someone you know has a car (or if you're down to Uber/Lyft), you'd be able to go to things in Cary or Chapel Hill or Raleigh which vastly increases the amount of things you can do/eat."
Duke,"https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/8hjpws/duke_social_hierarchy/

https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/67kmpm/concerned_about_not_fitting_in/

We need to sticky this honestly. A couple of dumb fucking people started this idea of a hierarchy existing at Duke and this idea has been perpetuated on Reddit for years.

I linked a couple of posts by people in similar positions! "
Duke,Are you competitive? 
Duke,The social scene is what you make of it. I seriously have like 3-4 friends and I’m perfectly happy here :)
Duke,4am-9am is a good time to get easy no nonsense rides. The vast majority of those pax are going to work or to the airport
Duke,"I would constant say 4-30 am - 9 am is/was my bread and butter. When I was full timing it I would switch to pizza delivery at like 11-onwards, but otherwise I think the early am shift is the most profitable there is"
Duke,No because traffic. Nighttime rules 🤙🏽
Duke,"probably if you work at 9. 5pm+ can work but tends to be less per hr. in my area. The benefit though is you have flexibility about when and where you finish. This can make your driving much more effecient

Possibly drive with destination set towards your work in the moring for 1 or 2 rides. And then for a couple hrs after work. That's what I think works best for 9-5 schedule..... OR, if you need serious cash, start like 4am and you can get plenty of good paying rides before work."
Duke,Depends the market you’re in I only do night time and I don’t do to bad keep in mind all streaks are in the am I could probably boost my earning my like 40 percent more but I don’t like dealing with traffic lol
Duke,From my experience mid day is the worst hours to do this so I do 4am - 9am then I do 8pm-12pm works best for me.
Duke,"It's fantastic that random people on Reddit are offering to help. If you're looking for an actual service, I think Errand Girl may do this. I've never used them and don't know anything about them, but their website seems promising.

Duke,"Me too, dm me if you need help."
Duke,"If the other offers fall through, I may be able to help!"
Duke,Have you asked Duke?  I would see if they may have some suggestions on this.
Duke,I've had the same problem in the past I was lucky enough to have a friend able to pick me up after the procedure they didn't say that they had to stay the whole time they really just need somebody to discharge you to. I haven't used them yet but I've heard that Wisdom Care provides this service.
Duke,"Medical groups, like the American Cancer Society sometimes have a program"
Duke,When?
Duke,Testing.
Duke,"OP what kind of healthcare coverage do you have?

Certain Medicare and Medicaid patients have reimbursements for medical transports."
Duke,Uber or Lyft have both worked for me. Schedule it in advance if it’s early.
Duke,https://townietransport.com/
Duke,"It depends on the time of day. If it’s very early and you need to leave before 7 am, Lyft and Uber can be unreliable. Even if you reserve early, it does NOT guarantee you will have a ride. I learned that the hard way. It just means you get like “priority” or something. I have had a few close calls, and the last time I tried to rely on those, I had a very stressful VERY close call that ended with my frantically calling traditional cab companies."
Duke,You can take the bus! Take the 800 or 805 to the main to triangle station and then take the 100.
Duke,"So I've used Uber and Lyft early mornings but schedule the request or make the request a bit earlier than you would otherwise for a margin of safety in getting to the airport.

Now getting back from the airport later at night can be problematic. You are competing for rides from everyone else landing late and all the revelers in Raleigh. This is actually what led me to just driving and parking myself. Fast Park and Ride works pretty good if you aren't parking in the main garage."
Duke,I use Taxi Taxi when Ubers are scarce
Duke,I've been picked up as early as 4:30 a.m. with Lyft and never had a problem. It's about $25 from northern Chapel Hill. Minus the tip.
Duke,Uber
Duke,FYI Uber scheduling is “real” scheduling i.e. generally you will have a driver assigned to you the night before or something. Lyft scheduling is auto-request where sometimes drivers will see you in advance but it’s not as firm a commitment as Uber.
Duke,"I used Rdu taxi. They apparently sold the website and phone #’s, but it’s many of the same drivers.  They are happy to schedule early morning service."
Duke,"GoRDU.com guaranteed on time to RDU, conveniently located at RDU, 24 hour service, easy to book on GoRDU.com up to 6 passengers in their 2023 suburbans and escalades, Tesla SUVs and taxi service. Don’t risk your trip with the competitors you know they suck."
OSU,"the Lyft pass shouldn't be dependent on tips, I never had it deactivate due to that. if you went to the Kroger in clintonville then that is outside of the service area which would cause the Lyft pass to not work. if you went to the one near short north then that's odd and should've worked. also keep in mind you have to do a standard ride and the ""Wait and Save"" option in order to get the discount. Here's a link to the documentation with the service area and guidelines: [Lyft Ride Smart ](https://ttm.osu.edu/ride-smart)"
OSU,"The way the pass works, is OSU basically gives Lyft a set amount of money, almost like a giant gift card every month for all students. Then as the month goes by the money slowly runs down and sometimes out. Considering it’s the end of the month, that’s likely what happened"
OSU,">pay for our safety

Dont let anyone tell you these drivers are nearly as well vetted. Safe ride drivers were OSU students who had to pass a FULL background check and maintain training as members of the Department of Public Safety."
OSU,"Nothing stops Lyft from just raising the rates in OSU service area. Safety ride features was never for convenience but for safety. It worked adequately in providing safety. The tapride app needed some work, but that doesn't mean that USG should be just allowed to kill it."
OSU,"I personally think this is a good idea, though I might not be in the majority. The sheer volume of Lyft drivers in the area will more than make this worth it, though idk how effective the Safe Ride was before as I never used it. Many of my friends would use Uber/Lyft anyways last year, and this service being offered for ~$2 per ride (less than a full cycle of laundry) makes me think it'll be very useful and very effective."
OSU,free ride to get dominos at latenight:-)
OSU,Right after they raised tuition etc. Poor form.
OSU,I remember when it used to be like $3 to get around campus
OSU,Hi! I'm currently looking into this issue for the Lantern. Would you be interested in speaking with me about this briefly? You can just message me and we can go from there if you're comfortable!
OSU,I emailed them last year cus I had the same problem and they resent the email. After that I haven’t had any problems
OSU,"Nah you gotta show us the name of the driver, so we can all give the driver 1 star if we ever get the same driver"
OSU,Can you do a charge back with your bank?
OSU,This is why I hated that OSU got rid of their own late night driver system and opted for Lyft where it’s random ass people picking up college kids. I know we all use Uber and Lyft to go to bars and all that but just seemed wrong to change the system from actual OSU employees. Actually USG is the one that opted for the change so they can screw off (as always). Sorry op that this happened to you :/
OSU,"they should have safe ride *and* the Lyft program. I use(d) them for different things.. safe ride to get home from campus at night, and the Lyft program to get cheap rides to and from bars/friends at night. Having both would've helped solve the long wait times of the safe ride system"
OSU,This is why they should have never gotten rid of safe ride. Some people will never ever get into a car of a complete stranger alone and so the program is inequitable.
OSU,This fuckin pisses me off just reading it. I hope karma finds this guy. Sorry OP
OSU,So sorry this happened op! This is horrible!
OSU,Report to your bank ASAP. You have a limited time to report fraudulent/unauthorized charges and once that passes you're SOL
OSU,I would call CPD back and at least ask for a police report. You can then show that to your bank and should have no problem disputing the charge.
OSU,"always use it around campus, I’ve gotten tons of ride for under a dollar. never a problem"
OSU,"Lyft is comparable to Uber. Basically the same service and many drivers drive for both apps. 

Just keep in mind the campus area discount only works from 9p-3a (or something like that)."
OSU,It works through the year unless you drop out of OSU or graduate.
OSU,"Yes, it worked for us last summer so I guess it applies to this year too"
OSU,"Hope the tour guides weren't hyping up our ""free safety ride program"" all summer."
OSU,"On the other hand, they've replaced a free service with one that costs students money. Particularly once the monthly allotment runs out."
OSU,I can't wait to use this as it was not intended for $2 rides to short north bars
OSU,Safe Ride worked fine for me. It's infuriating that we have to pay now.
OSU,"cool stuff THE Ohio State University has done!

- outsourced energy (for the next 50 years)

- outsourced parking (for the next 50 years)

- outsourced safe rides

- signed an exclusive beverage deal (for 10 years, three decades in a row)

- created classes that require a specific 300 dollar product for every student"
OSU,"It looks like this area doesn't cover University Village at all, which with the old Safe Ride, had limited service to after 12:30 am (like, okay I kinda get that). UV buses only run until 10pm, so a resident's only option is to either use COTA and walk from Ackerman or Riverside, or just get a regular Uber/Lyft. I think this program concept overall is great, but I wish the current ride share had just been modified to fit students' needs better. That money could've easily gone towards getting another vehicle or two."
OSU,Am I the only one who was actually really excited to see this? Safe ride always had absurdly long wait times which is why I never used it. Usually a Lyft shows up about 5 minutes after I call it. Maybe I've just gotten unlucky with safe ride but to me this seems like a great move by OSU.
OSU,"Ohio State sure does care about our safety. This isn't a move made based on money at all. No way. 

I'll wait for someone to be attacked, assaulted, or raped by their driver and then let the legal games begin. 

They may be cutting down on wait times, but there were many ways to fix the student safety program that would've helped while maintaining a free, and actually safe program. Not replacing it for the rich students who can afford a $2 ride every night, and also with drivers who aren't vetted at all. Oh well, Ohio State will learn there lesson after we have something terrible happen because they wanted to save a few dollars"
OSU,Man I love paying money to feel safe
OSU,"Dont forget this was supported by administration AND USG! The Safe Ride program also gave double or triple that amount of rides in a year previously.

And dont let OSU tell you they dont put a price on safety!"
OSU,"Meanwhile my friend who was discussing with OSU security about a partnership with her personal safety app basically was dismissed because “her app didn’t make money,” and “they’re not interested in threats to safety, only real crimes”

1 year later: partners with a service that costs money for “safety”"
OSU,"The safe ride program was great in theory, but it in actuality it was slow, and long waits, and not the easiest to use. If the 10,000 rides are a reasonable number, then this makes a lot of sense"
OSU,How will we know that the limit has expired?
OSU,"Most of the responses in this thread, are well, quite hypocritical. u/ will mumble about how tuition is high because of useless commodities, services, and programs, but complain when OSU cuts back on a largely inefficient money drain.

Stop blowing hot air like you're in a congressional subcommittee. We all have a whole lot of wishes attatched to a finite budget. Leaving an issue like this to the free market seems to be the best option because it's a rarely (truthfully) used, often abused dump. For just a few bucks you can get something you probably would not have used anyways. 

Students should learn how to mitigate danger presented to them independently, as they will have to in life post-college. I think it's time for the training wheels to come off."
OSU,"It looks like the service area is somewhat large, but doesn't quite [reach the Short North](https://i.imgur.com/gEQ463M.png)"
OSU,When is this email from
OSU,"Safety, brought to you by the same people that also deliver take out with a 25% chance of free sampling for themselves included."
OSU,[deleted]
OSU,"Safety is our missing name. Cause when you are trying to get home and its late, lyft is the safest option. SMH"
OSU,What stops Lyft from just raising the rates for OSU service area by USD 4?
OSU,"There are only 10,000 discounted rides a month. Resets on Monday."
University of Minnesota,"I have, might be a bit pricier but usually there's drivers in the cities all night."
University of Minnesota,"You'll be fine. Schedule it in advance to save some $$$, too. I've done this on a few early AM flights and never had an issue."
University of Minnesota,Ive taken Ubers at all hours and never had an issue
University of Minnesota,Book an uber ride. Is advance booking something you've never tried before?
University of Minnesota,You can request an driver on the spot or set up a pick up time in the scheduler .
University of Minnesota,I actually got a ride to the airport around 4 am couple of months ago and i found lyft is the cheapest and they have a lot more drivers around that time than you think
University of Minnesota,I flew about 3-4 times for a 6am flight from MSP airport in the past year. I had no issue finding an Uber at around 3:00-3:30am near where I live. I did not schedule a ride in advance because they cost like 54$ the last time I checked.
University of Minnesota,"here's a fun fact: when Austin, TX passed a similar ordinance Uber & Lyft did make good on their threats and pulled out of the city, but pretty much as soon as they did a new company called Ride Austin started up that offered the same level of service (just on a very local level) that paid people adequately AND got them around for similar prices. The only reason Ride Austin doesn't exist anymore is because Uber & Lyft came back and a global pandemic broadly tanked needs for rideshares for a year."
University of Minnesota,Yup. Uber ran the same ad on KFAN this morning. They're pumping a lot of money into the campaign meant to keep them from having to pump money into their drivers bank accounts
University of Minnesota,"Lyft and Uber didn't pull out of Seattle, NYC or other cities that have passed a livable wage for drivers.

Don't give in to threats. That's how we ended up building the Vikings a new stadium."
University of Minnesota,I heard an Uber commercial on the radio today calling for us to contact the city to ensure they stay. lol whatever it takes to keep them from paying a fair share
University of Minnesota,"I think the issues with it last time were:

1) the price increases would be material. Just looked on Lyft. Target field to MSP would be ~$27 before tip. With this legislation, the driver would be paid ~$26 for the trip ($1.40 * 13 miles + $0.51 * 15 min) before tip. Lyft/Uber & taxi companies are going to take their margin resulting in higher prices.

2) this only applies to ride share drivers & not other gig drivers (instacart, etc.)

3) drivers wanted employment protection to the point where only a conviction would result in Lyft/Uber being able to deactivate the driver immediately.

4) ride share drivers would be treated different than taxi drivers."
University of Minnesota,Kind of like pro sports teams threatening to leave if the tax payers don't pay up
University of Minnesota,"if you are ever sent something like this from a company, do the opposite of whatever it says"
University of Minnesota,"As a part time Uber driver since 2015, the knucklehead drivers behind this can go shove it.


 It's a job you literally don't have to apply for and I average over 30 dollars an hour when I drive, that is, anywhere from 4-10 on the weekdays and 12-10 on the weekends if I do choose to drive.  


Anyone who isn't making shockingly good money for a near zero skill job is doing something horribly wrong. 


Now I'm not saying we line Lyft and Ubers pockets because fuck them too, but a minimum wage guarantee for drivers is asshattery to the highest degree.  


I drive for additional spending money AND the fantastic conversations and connections I can make with people. I can confidently say I'm far more worldly for driving nearly 10 years with how many people I've interacted with. Instead of sitting in a nice little cocoon of safety I'm out meeting people from all parts of the cities and the globe"
University of Minnesota,"Speaking as someone who doesn't have a car, this is the best option. Public transportation in this city is good to the point where Uber and Lyft really aren't my go to options. These Multi billion dollar companies are just throwing a hissy fit cus they can't exploit their workers anymore."
University of Minnesota,"I love how gig workers want the freedom of being a contractor and the protection of being a standard employee. You can have one, or the other. You can't have both. No ones forcing you to work for lyft. If you want a minimum wage, Walmart is hiring."
University of Minnesota,"Does anyone know if there is actual data available on this?  The articles seem to only mention anecdotal reports from drivers and Lyft and Uber are saying fares will double.   There truth is probably somewhere in the middle but really difficult to determine.

Obviously Uber and Lyft used cheap rates to undercut taxis, but at the same time it never seemed like it was meant to be someone’s full time job."
University of Minnesota,Let them leave. Fuck em. Another rideshare company will come in. 
University of Minnesota,A lot of people are going to lose their jobs and independence because of this…
University of Minnesota,"Lyft has pretty much given up on this market anyway. Their prices are not competitive and even if you do a request a ride, the chances of a driver accepting it are slim. "
University of Minnesota,"So if this passes, that means I don’t have to tip? Because this driver is earning a living wage and therefore I don’t need to subsidize their pay?"
University of Minnesota,edit
University of Minnesota,"The Metro Transit website has a [carpool matching system](https://www.metrotransit.org/carpool) that connects people with similar commutes. You’ll likely have better luck on that website than on Reddit.

Also, have you tried explaining your situation to your hiring manager or someone in HR at Medtronic? Given that you’re working remotely more than half of the week to begin with, they might let you work remotely full-time until you get a car."
University of Minnesota,Have you looked into Plymouth Metrolink? There are express buses that run between campus and locations in Plymouth
University of Minnesota,You might try cross-posting to twin cities and Minneapolis subreddits as well to hit a wider range of folks. Good luck!
University of Minnesota,"I’m pretty sure you’re going to be able to find a coworker commuting from somewhere close to you. Chances are they’ll be a recent grad, and live near the U as well. You could just split gas with them and call it a day.
I’d suggest just waiting it out/making connections at the job or asking your manager if they know someone that fits the criteria.
I’ve been in your shoes a couple of times and the above has always worked out for me :)"
University of Minnesota,"Maybe try asking in the IEEE and ACM Discords. For some reason a lot of engineering firms and software firms are in Plymouth.

To be honest though, you might need to get a car though. That was the reason I had to get my driver's license."
University of Minnesota,~2 hours of time + gas/car wear and tear for $25?
University of Minnesota,"Implementing minimum wage laws on rideshare hasnt caused Lyft or Uber to leave a municipality yet. See: Seattle, NYC"
University of Minnesota,"""Rideshare companies will stop operating which will make rideshares twice as expensive. "" 
I'm not sure they understand what they're writing."
University of Minnesota,"Fwiw this is just they’re playbook, and ultimately an empty threat to get you to vote and advocate for their profit interests and not that of their drivers. I moved here from San Francisco in January and they were sending these emails to SF and Bay Area rideshare users with almost the exact same wording when we were considering similar measures there a couple years ago. 

Ultimately the measure passed by a wide margin against the rideshare companies and their predatory practices and they did nothing except raise their prices a bit, like maybe 5%-10%. Their threats of pulling out of the market were empty and that this would kill their industry was all just a bluff. The price increase though could also be interpreted as unrelated to the measure and as more a result of inflation than anything for that time."
University of Minnesota,"I got one from Uber too.

Is anyone especially concerned about making it harder for Uber/Lyft to remove drivers after a safety incident? I'm sure there are people who make false reports, but as a woman, I'm way more concerned about my driver having harassed/assaulted a rider, and then still being allowed to drive me the next day."
University of Minnesota,They're bluffing.
University of Minnesota,"It would be collectively awful if we lost rideshare apps. But I understand the wage arguments. 

Lyft and Uber made a bad decision banking on automated driving far too soon. 

But I also remember the days of having to negotiate $60 cash fares with cabs just to get somewhere close. It was not a fun time."
University of Minnesota,"So how would this actually work in practice - I get a ride pick up in Saint Paul and want to go to US Bank Stadium. Would the driver drop me off on the border? Drop me off at US Bank and then have to drive outside of Minneapolis proper to get another pick up? 

Seems totally infeasible and an empty threat even from a logistics perspective"
University of Minnesota,"I rely on Uber/Lyft 4x a week to get home since Metro Transit decided to cancel my early morning route.  I see profiles that show drivers have been doing it for several years in many cases, why are they still driving if they're not making decent money?"
University of Minnesota,[deleted]
University of Minnesota,How is paying people fair wages “unsafe”?
University of Minnesota,If your business would fall apart by paying workers a living wage maybe it isn't a sustainable one and you shouldn't be paying your CEO up to [$980 million](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-lyft-ceos-unusual-pay-structure-is-a-sign-of-the-times-bbc2bbd4) in stock
University of Minnesota,Fuck corporations influencing politics.
University of Minnesota,"The rideshare companies have done this everywhere with any regulations and haven't stopped operating anywhere. 

Certainly, go [read the rules yourselves](https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/FileV2/32072/Transportation-Ride-Share-Worker-Protection-Ordinance.pdf) and ask your councilmember to represent your ideals. 

Lyft or any rideshare company urging a no vote is an automatic yes vote from me."
University of Minnesota,Bring back yellow taxis and privately owned car services
University of Minnesota,"Passing the buck down to the consumer will happen. What everyone should realize is that without cheap labor or money companies like Uber/Lyft wouldn't exist. 

It's why Lyft isn't profitable and Uber only just barely became profitable for the first time in its entire history."
University of Minnesota,"""Well...... Bye."""
University of Minnesota,I think Minneapolis should take this time to put money back into local rideshare. Incentivizing cab companies to make their own apps and or making their own. I was on a lyft the other day (missed my bus) and it was apart of a Minneapolis Transit effort.
University of Minnesota,Okay for sure voting yes now
University of Minnesota,Translation: “If you force us to start paying drivers a livable wage then we’ll have to stop tricking drivers into thinking they can earn a livable wage.”
University of Minnesota,"""Everybody let us do what we want and nobody gets hurt!"" Fuck off, Lyft."
University of Minnesota,"If your business can't pay the people that do the work for you a living wage, you shouldn't be in business."
University of Minnesota,"This is what happens when we start relying on transportation as a private service as opposed to a public service. If Lyft/uber/whoever cannot be profitable while also paying their employees (they'd say contractors) acceptable wages, then maybe they just shouldn't exist."
University of Minnesota,[deleted]
University of Minnesota,"I was looking for more information online after I got this email myself and I learned that Walz actually vetoed a ridershare wage increase bill at the state level in May, and (supposedly) created a committee tasked with researching rideshare issues to ""shape policy for next year's legislative session.""

https://sahanjournal.com/business-work/a-proposed-ordinance-to-increase-wages-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers-in-minneapolis-has-both-rideshare-apps-threatening-to-leave/

Sounds like the city council didn't want to wait. Frey is still undecided on the issue, according to that article.

I don't have much sympathy for the rideshare providers. Just because they refuse to treat their drivers like employees doesn't mean those workers should be exempt from minimum wage requirements."
University of Minnesota,The last time Uber and Lyft hid behind disabled people in Dakota County. I wonder what the excuse will be this time.
University of Minnesota,Not buying it. Try again! 😂
University of Minnesota,There are other legitimate cab services in the metro area.
University of Minnesota,Bye!
University of Minnesota,Whoa I wouldn't care even if this weren't a blatant lie
University of Minnesota,"I only use rideshare when I go out to concerts or the airport. If rates have to go up slightly to cover fair wages, then so be it. That said, there should be some transparency involved in this process and overseen by the state of Minnesota so that companies don’t flat out gouge customers under the guise of “uNfAiR rEgUlaTioNs”"
University of Minnesota,Whiny corpo bitches. This is the exact same bullshit that companies say to push back against minimum wage increases. Fuck em. If they can't afford to pay the workers a living wage (the same workers that make their business possible) then I look forward to the return of taxi companies.
University of Minnesota,"That's so much bullshit... They aren't gunna leave.

All the greedy companies need to be taught that there is an honest person ready to start a business as soon as the greedy competitor is out of the way.go ahead... leave..."
University of Minnesota,Lyft is usually twice as expensive as Uber right now anyway... They have bigger issues than this they need to resolve first just to keep their current market.
University of Minnesota,"Saying this as a non-driver who relies heavily on Lyft here: Lyft can eat it. I got this same type of email when they were pushing Prop 22 in San Francisco and I’m still furious that that passed. They weren’t ever going to leave San Francisco, much less CA as a whole (which they were literally threatening—like, come on), and they quite likely won’t leave here either. If they do, there will be other options."
University of Minnesota,God I hate corporate propaganda.
University of Minnesota,"good, fuck lyft and uber those vultures

University of Minnesota,"""Dear Lyft

As opposed to dog shit rides worth 4$? Lol?"
University of Minnesota,What a bunch of fear mongering and bullshit
University of Minnesota,"What a bunch of bullshit bullying tactics…

There is NO fucking way Uber or Lyft are going to take their services out of the 16th largest metro in the fucking country.

Boo-fucking-hoo! Pay your fucking drivers!"
University of Minnesota,Aaaaand deleted *that* account.
University of Minnesota,Is this the issue with the wage increase for their employees or something else?
University of Minnesota,Uber sent me the same email word-for-word
University of Minnesota,"We only have 4.67 billion dollars!!! You’ll have to pay the drivers more because we just couldn’t possibly pay our drivers a livable wage, we’re too poor!!!"
University of Minnesota,The pay isn’t the biggest problem. They can’t deactivate drivers who pose safety issues without five days written notice. Think about how dumb that is.
University of Minnesota,K bye
University of Minnesota,Okay
University of Minnesota,"I. Am. So. Afraid.

Any leverage for the little ones is seen as a threat."
University of Minnesota,they said the same threats to Seattle and guess what they never left Seattle after they passed similar laws
University of Minnesota,"Fuck em. There are smaller, some co-op based rideshare companies here who would greatly benefit from the duopoly collapsing under its own greed."
University of Minnesota,Oh I'm sure these companies making drivers operate at a net loss or best case less than minimum wage really care about the drivers 🙄
University of Minnesota,Ohhhhh noooooo! I totally hate riding my bike down awesome paths that pretty much get me to anywhere I want. Man I’m really going to miss getting into random peoples cars and paying a lot of money for nothing. Shucks.
University of Minnesota,"So will they stop operating or double their prices? Do they just expect us to also believe that higher wages is both unsafe and costly? Costly I understand for riders Why is it unsafe for anyone?

Edit: I see the bit about allowing drivers to continue, but I have no idea what Lyft does now other than using its ratings to prioritize. Not sure that is a real safety check"
University of Minnesota,Call their bluff. If paying their drivers minimum wage is too burdensome so be it.
University of Minnesota,"Fuck lyft

dumbass corporation bitching about having to follow some rules. I wish they would GTFO out of my city, but my dumbass city council have no principles or spine to do anything."

University of Minnesota,If they're still making money here they will stay.
University of Minnesota,"Hmm...this makes me feel like their local lobbying might not be as effective. There is no justifiable reason why the company can't keep operating affordably even if they have to pay their drivers more. On a side note, I read somewhere today that despite inflation and a decline in profits, Medtronic's CEO pay ratio to their median worker **increased** from 215:1 to 230:1.

Feel free to raise your prices or do whatever you want Lyft, but understand that a possible consequence is that the market won't react favorably. What you won't do is feign concern about the well-being of the drivers and costs to the customers when we know that all you care about is your profit. 

I'll be telling the City Council to vote ""Yes"". My deepest sympathy to your shareholders and investors."
University of Minnesota,CALL. THEIR. BLUFF.

University of Minnesota,**Bye**
University of Minnesota,"This sound slike anti union jargon. 

Vote yes"
University of Minnesota,"While typically I would agree market openings lead way to better competitors, we’ve already seen the alternatives so far from traditional taxi companies. Apps like iHail, zTrip, and Ridesure are out there and they all suck across the board from inconsistent payments, bad updating of location, and terrible interfaces.

Given the cost of becoming a licensed ride share company in the city (btw none of those apps are) it’s a huge uphill battle for new entrants."
University of Minnesota,"Politely, you really have no idea what you are talking about. From both a basic economics standpoint and the basics of running a business basically everything you wrote is nonsense.

Any new entity that tried to replace Uber/Lyft in just the metro would likely need to make significantly more operating profit just to be able to cover their fixed costs and stay in business. And they would have a much smaller customer base to do it with. And to be clear, we're not talking about the whole Twin Cities, it's just Minneapolis and St. Paul, so you're really looking at a market of less than a million.

And that doesn't even begin to account for the fact that Uber/Lyft were able to build their infrastructure over a decade during a much lower interest rate environment and operated at significant losses for years. Apparently this new company just needs to be willing to make less money than companies than have famously lost billions of dollars before they even became profitable? 

And creating the app would probably be one of the easier parts of getting the business of the ground. Both dealing with the legal aspects and successfully recruiting a reliable driver base are going to be a much harder part of getting this sort of business started.  

And an extra $1 a ride would almost certainly not come close to meeting minimum salary demands of riders, let alone all the other costs associated."
University of Minnesota,You make software development seem so easy. It is not.
University of Minnesota,">Making the app is the hard part, but after that it's just maintenance. Keep it running well and you have a turnkey operation on your hands.

..."
University of Minnesota,"They pulled out of Austin, allowed a competitor to spring up, and then moved back in to kill it.

Their long term strategy is to stay in cities. Unless they collude with each other, the competitor will gladly move back in to claim a monopoly over a city."
University of Minnesota,"A fellow in Seattle just has a static website and gets calls. RidesbyDan or something. He advertised on Craigslist.

University of Minnesota,"Meh. I always found it annoying to have to have $40 in cash on me just to convince a cabby to drive me 3 miles home. If I could find one to begin with. 

There’s a reason people stopped using cabs"
University of Minnesota,"No one:

Op: just create a new ride hailing service without economies of scale"
University of Minnesota,"I can't tell if this is a horrible sarcastic post or an OP seriously out of touch with reality, but I know this is truly a case of ""if this was so damn simple it'd been done""

> The second, is to be willing to make less money than Lyft and Uber do per ride. Making the app is the hard part, but after that it's just maintenance. Keep it running well and you have a turnkey operation on your hands. You do not need to make that much money per ride to be successful, you just need to make some money. Even if it's only a dollar a ride, there is around 4 million people in the Twin Cities. That dollar would add up very quickly.

Please feel free to read. Look at when that article was made. Look at how much they lost. Think about how long you've known of the term ""Uber"", and how only two years ago did they finally make money. 

For this to have stemmed with looking out for driver's pay and ending with ""oh, don't worry about yourself making money"" is comical"
University of Minnesota,OP gone full send on the open marketplace mythology. Just because there’s a vacuum doesn’t mean that what replaces it is an improvement to anyone.
University of Minnesota,They're not going to leave.  They're threatening to leave like they have with any other place that's tried to get the people working for them to get more money
University of Minnesota,"In addition to all of the other reasons this will be terrible, I use Uber and Lyft all of the time to avoid a DUI, as well as avoid mistakenly killing someone.  If you go to a bar and have 2-3 drinks you are over the limit, and driving home can put you in jail, cost you your job, cost $10,000, etc.  This will also cause deaths due to people still wanting to go out, only having to drive themselves."
University of Minnesota,The lengths people go to in order to avoid investing in good public transportation infrastructure...
University of Minnesota,"Other competition already exists, and its terrible.  Uber and Lyft came in because cabs were overpriced, and inconvenient.  

Do I agree that Uber and Lyft drivers should make more?  Absolutely.  But, the only way they can make more is if Uber and Lyft CHARGE more.  Uber and Lyft are already basically the perfect example of capitalism, since the rides are priced based on the supply of drivers to the supply of riders.  Should that change?  Having never driven for Uber or Lyft I really am unqualified to say one way or the other.  But if it does, you'll pay that cost, Uber and Lyft certainly won't eat it."
University of Minnesota,App development and maintenance would be over 100 million probably. 
University of Minnesota,"Ride-sharing is unfortunately not a profitable venture… Uber’s whole plan was the corner the market so that when they had a fleet of self-driving cars, they could finally start cashing in without having to pay drivers. 

What we need is better public transportation that’s already paid for by our tax dollars so that we don’t have to spend $30 every time we want to go anywhere"
University of Minnesota,"This is funny because the process for building a competitor business that you just described was the process Uber and Lyft used...so you're just saying ""hey, somebody DIY recreate an enormous company real quick, what's the big deal?"" 

I don't support Uber or Lyft but this argument as you've voiced it is silly level of naive"
University of Minnesota,No I'd rather pay more than let them leave because I don't drive
University of Minnesota,Tell me you have never taken a taxi without telling me you have never taken a taxi.
University of Minnesota,Just take the light rail.  I have heard great things.
University of Minnesota,"If you believe in supply and demand, then why not let supply and demand play its course? The fact the government is getting involved is an unnatural and detrimental affect to supply and demand.

Leaving a hole in the market would work to bring in competition if there wasn't an artifical barrier to entry. It'd be like getting rid of all the coffee shops in the twin cities and saying, to sell coffee now you need to pay a fee that's untenable. Well, I *would have* opened up a coffee shop to fill the gap and take in all that revenue, but now there are government fees and restrictions that make it completely not worth doing.

I get the *idea* that people *would* make more money with a higher minimum wage, but that's no longer true if the job no longer exists. We're no longer helping these people make more money by getting rid of the jobs."
University of Minnesota,"I'm hoping those drivers go to work for Metro Transit instead.  Their biggest problem is finding staff, and a fully staffed agency would make rideshares mostly unnecessary.

For extenuating circumstances, there are still traditional taxi services that maintain their own vehicles and pay drivers as employees, the way Uber and Lyft should be doing anyway."
University of Minnesota,Have they ever actually followed through on these threats in the other places they've made them?
University of Minnesota,"I can’t wait to download a new rando, glitchy app to get from point a to b.

I’m not worried about it, I don’t think Uber or Lyft is going anywhere, it’s too valuable and will fuck up too much stuff if it goes away."
University of Minnesota,I miss car2go. :( They were forced out of the city as well.
University of Minnesota,This is a bluff.  They’ll simply introduce price floors and rides will cost more to consumers.
University of Minnesota,I was talking with one of my Lyft drivers and was relatively new to the country. He was renting a car from Lyft for $250 a week and didn’t realize he was going to be taxed out the ass on the money earned.
University of Minnesota,"You're just optimistic, lol. Do it yourself OP

>The second, is to be willing to make less money than Lyft and Uber do per ride.

...they aren't making money. This entire post is so dumb"
University of Minnesota,Cabs have always been fucked. So many times I have been left in the cold when they ask where we are going and when it’s not a good fare for them all of a sudden they are busy and drive off. Not to mention countless arguments about how the credit card machine does not work and how they only want cash. They were always awful and rude!!!
University of Minnesota,How about we let the market figure this out instead of the govt? Is anyone forcing people to drive for these companies?
University of Minnesota,"Not sure I agree with everything in OP's post, but it's true that a substantial reason for Uber/Lyft's success is that they 1) haven't ever had to make a profit, and 2) don't pay their workers fairly.

Uber and Lyft are a net detriment to the Twin Cities because they aren't regulated and they pull people off public transit. 

We should invest in more frequent, cleaner, better-staffed public transit and let taxi companies fill whatever demand exists for Uber and lyft."
University of Minnesota,I’d love for a group like Hourcar/Evie to come in and setup a cooperatively operated version of these services.
University of Minnesota,Wait my next door neighbors are immigrants and the husband is an Uber/lyft driver and he has a new baby. I’d hate for him to be suddenly out of work 😭😭 so many immigrants do ridesharing
University of Minnesota,Uber and Lyft would pull out because MN recognizing their workers as employees and not contractors would open up the flood gate of legal liability in other states (as MN would be a direct point of comparison). Their long-term wellbeing would depend on them pulling out. The company has been systemically losing cases for years now and is delaying the inevitable. Fuck Uber and Lyft and their soulless business practices. I hope MN calls their bluff and makes them pull
University of Minnesota,It happened exactly like this in Austin.
University of Minnesota,Sweet summer child. Just a software? The legal hurdles alone are just the tip of the iceberg.
University of Minnesota,Invest in better public transit.
University of Minnesota,Ride share apps exploit workers. Trains and busses are the way.
University of Minnesota,"And bus/light rail were like “Hi? We have been always here for you…?”   

All of this Uber/Lyft problem won’t be severe if urban planning priorities the city zoning around the bus and light rail routes… It is a time-tested and proven system since before Ancient Roman time. Single family housing zoning is a huge problem."
University of Minnesota,"Generally speaking, when a service disappears its usually gone for good. Uber and Lyft were only ever affordable at the beginning because they were being pumped with venture capital at ludicrously low interest rates. But once investors started demanding a return on their investment and interest rates went up these ride share companies needed to start making a profit. There are two major ways to make a profit (in the eyes of the capitalist); cut costs and increase prices. The fact that Uber/Lyft are pulling out of the market because ***minimum wage*** makes their business model unprofitable means their business model doesn't work, at least without operating at a loss. 

So if the business model failed, no one will come in to replace them because no one can make a profit off of the business model. If they did we would still have street car companies and milk men. Now there is a way for services to be preserved, and that is if we replace the investor with the tax payer. We *could* spin an uber/lyft style company off as an agency and use our collective pooled money to fund it. but we already have something like that, and the agency is called Metrotransit. 

I agree with you that the exit of Uber/Lyft could be a net positive, but not because better version of the ride share model will appear. But because some of the supply and demand will move to public transit options."
University of Minnesota,"This seems like a spot for a business like Empower to come in and thrive. I’m not totally advocating for it, and it has its issues, but it is cheaper, and riders typically make more as well."
University of Minnesota,Gig workers deserve protection
University of Minnesota,"Imagine if we had a company that actually had to EMPLOY rideshare drivers…. Maybe they would even be required to provide vehicles and check on licensure…. Oh, like ducking taxis used to do?!?! Yes, pass this shit! Uber and lift are criminal exploitation. Often of immigrants"
University of Minnesota,"Uber and Lyft leaving Minneapolis would cost me personally negatively affect me because that’s what I exclusively use for transportation. I will use any alternative that takes their place. 

I’m not talking Metro Transit, ever. And as a poor person receiving DAC, it would save lots of money, but I refuse to take it out of principle. So the car abolitionists that are advocating for this can kiss my ass."
University of Minnesota,"News flash, they won't fucking pull out anyways... They just want to bitch and moan so they can keep their margins."
University of Minnesota,"There will be a small interruption, then someone else will step in that will follow the rules.

Lyft and Uber have no ""special sauce"" anymore. When they left Austin years ago, well-running alternatives popped up within months.

Anyway, I find it hilarious how people turn into captain capitalist when it comes to defending uber and lyft in these threads."
University of Minnesota,Let them leave.  Fuck them and the crusted over bandaid they pretend to provide.
University of Minnesota,"Who is forcing the drivers to work for Uber or lyft? Are they not aware of the pay before the start driving? I haven't taken many rides with these companies, but when I have,it seemed like it was more of a second job. Or even a hobby for some of the drivers."
University of Minnesota,"I take Uber often. I love talking to drivers. So many incredible stories & journeys.
I always tip 50%. 
It is an unsustainable model….though when it’s needed it is very needed."
University of Minnesota,Their threats are empty.  I do not care as I never use them but it reminds me of pro sports owners whining for tax money or they will leave
University of Minnesota,They're not going anywhere.
University of Minnesota,"If the Uber and Lyft drivers are not making enough they should quit... That's the true market, if it's not paying enough stop doing it. Lyft and Uber would be required to pay more. That's how it's supposed to work."
University of Minnesota,"Yep, call the bluff. If they leave someone will fill their place (they won’t leave anyway)."
University of Minnesota,The app could easily be run by AI and the drivers should get the majority of the money.
University of Minnesota,"Exactly, something else will fill that void. I use a semi-local service for grocery delivery called Buncha (they’re also in Denver) and it’s almost the same as Instacart but set delivery days so much cheaper. 

I also have been using another local company—  Evie Car share /Hourcar instead of Uber/lyft for a while now, because it ends up being much cheaper. (I just pay for the $7 monthly membership which is actually drive credits and then cancel immediately after since I tend to not use it every month.) Obviously this doesn’t help people who don’t / can’t drive, but it’s just to say, Uber and Lyft aren’t that special. Sure it was special back when they created it but it’s not impossible to replicate."
University of Minnesota,"Pre-COVID, I thought that having ""slug lanes"" would have been beneficial to cut down traffic on 35W and 394. They're basically organized group hitchhiking common in the Northern Virginia suburbs of DC. [http://www.slug-lines.com/](http://www.slug-lines.com/)  Drivers pick up passengers at designated origin points in the suburbs, use the HOV lanes, then drop off at center points downtown. Do the reverse in the evening. No coordination required."
University of Minnesota,I use them both and see no difference.
University of Minnesota,"I try to use Lyft but Uber connects me with a driver much faster. Recently I’ve stopped trying Lyft because it won’t connect to a driver, especially from the airport."
University of Minnesota,"Lyft links to my Delta account as well as earning me more points through my credit card, but I still check both. If it’s within a couple bucks I’ll go Lyft."
University of Minnesota,"In my experience over the last year, they've gotten very close to each other. On average, Lyft is a little less expensive, and Uber slightly more reliable in terms of timing and finding drivers. I did have a very strange experience with Uber this summer where the driver somehow kept the ride going after dropping me off, resulting in a $200 ride for what was supposed to be $30, but Uber customer service fixed it right away."
University of Minnesota,Both. It’s a capitalist world. Check both then go with the lower price.
University of Minnesota,"It depends on the situation for me. There are situations where I can save some money and wait a little longer, and that is usually with Lyft about 90% of the time. Lyft drivers give me better ratings to compared to Uber drivers. However, I can usually get a ride pretty quick with Uber."
University of Minnesota,"I mainly use Lyft because someone stole my debit card info, used Uber, I then reported it, and they locked and banned my account

If that's any indication....I never had a bad experience until that shitshow of a response."
University of Minnesota,"I've had better luck with Lyft, specifically when I try to schedule rides ahead of time. Sometimes I want to schedule a ride ahead of time when I need a morning ride, and Uber's app constantly glitches out and says I'm unable to, despite it supposedly being a function available on the app. I never have had that problem with Lyft, so I use Lyft. I like the peace of mind knowing I won't forget. Never had any problem finding a driver either."
University of Minnesota,"I use whichever one is cheaper, though I will prefer Uber if I need to get moving quickly. Lyft tends to bounce me around from one driver to another (and not because they're canceling!) which is very, very annoying."
University of Minnesota,Whichever one's cheaper in that exact moment you need a ride
University of Minnesota,Uber
University of Minnesota,"I only use Uber, but I tend to need very late night rides and Uber seems to have more drivers at that time. The airport is really the only time I may check out both platforms since it’s a long ride for me.

I have been to cities where Lyft is significantly cheaper, probably taking more losses to gain market share. I’ve been in NYC before where Lyft was much cheaper on all rides, so I used it for the duration of my trip."
University of Minnesota,"They’re both exactly the same and made up of the same exact drivers, most of whom use both apps. 

Just check the price on both apps and order whichever one is cheaper at that moment for that trip."
University of Minnesota,"Used to be Lyft, but now Uber seems to be about 25% cheaper"
University of Minnesota,"Uber by a mile, really consistent for me. Lyft might be getting better now, but for a couple of years I almost never had a Lyft ride not cancel/show up less than 10 minutes late."
University of Minnesota,As a new Lyft driver. . . Lyft
University of Minnesota,"Unfortunately, usually Uber. I've been screwed by Uber a few times and try not to use them, but they're almost always available (there have been times where I haven't even been able to get a Lyft, and not even weird times/locations, I'm talking 10pm on a Thursday in North Loop), and I've never had a particularly bad/sketchy Uber (had some really bad Lyft rides, and about ¼ of the time, the car feels unclean and/or beat up)."
University of Minnesota,I can't answer this but would like to know the same info for The Andover/Coon Rapids/Anoka area.  Have never used ride share.  Thanks
University of Minnesota,Ubers usually cheaper for me here but there less drivers generally
University of Minnesota,I’d say both are very close. In a smallish sample size though I’ve had more consistent luck with faster pickup with Uber from MSP
University of Minnesota,Maybe try an upgraded option with Uber or Lyft? Isn't there usually an option for a professionally licensed limo driver that drive big SUVs?
University of Minnesota,I go with whoever is cheaper so I can tip the driver heavier.
University of Minnesota,"Lyft's business model is to copy everything Uber does, and they often share drivers, so they're really the same thing."
University of Minnesota,"Try ""gophertrip""! It shows the bus routes, where they are, how full they are, yadda yadda!"
University of Minnesota,You'll need GroupMe. Used during welcome week and basically any time there is a group project
University of Minnesota,"Metro Transit has an app that's for tracking, schedules, and virtual tickets, but it's not very good...

University of Minnesota,UniDays is an app/website for student discounts!
University of Minnesota,PokemonGo. Seriously it's so fun to play on campus.
University of Minnesota,"Quizlet, electric scooter apps (Lime and Spin are the biggest ones), GopherTrip, Metro Transit, Tapingo, Canvas"

GopherTrip is a necessity. 

Handshake is very nice if you are trying to find a job on campus

Tapingo and other restaurant apps

Venmo is what a lot of people use to send money

Quizlet and Khan Acadamy helped me a lot with studying"
University of Minnesota,Hooked gives you discounts at random restaurants on campus. It's great! I think there are a few different apps with the same name but it's the one with the blue background.
University of Minnesota,"**Hooked** - gives you deals for local restaurants like DP Dough and Punch Pizza. 

**Symbolab**/ **Wolfram Alpha** - Very useful apps for lower level math classes.

**Starbucks** / **Caribou** / **Chipotle** - Pretty much all of the chain restaurants let you order with their app. Which is super useful for the long lines around campus. Sometimes while standing in-line, you can order using the app and get your food faster than staying in-line.

**Moovit** - Transit app that claims to give live arrival tracking for busses and trains. I haven't had a chance to check its accuracy yet."

University of Minnesota,"If Uber and Lyft's business models cannot support a living wage for drivers, why should they exist?"
University of Minnesota,"What I actually want put into law hasn't been proposed, which is actual visibility. Uber et all have a lot of talking points about what revenue share the drivers get, which completely doesn't seem to line up with what the uber drivers are saying. I should be able to see the dollar amount that goes to the driver in real time when I pay and they should be audited with hell to pay if what they tell the consumer doesn't line up with reality. Would even be nice to have it mandated by law to put next to that the averaged expenses and taxes the driver pays for that revenue, and their estimated actual profit.

A lot of what I actually see proposed seems heavy-handed and misguided and so far I've been relieved by the vetoes."
University of Minnesota,"Uber and Lyft: If you can't provide a living wage, not only should you leave Minneapolis, but you should be shut down.  You don't have a viable business model."
University of Minnesota,"This wouldn't be a problem if Walz didn't veto a bipartisan bill that had support of every DFL member in the House and Senate.

Uber threatened to leave Oregon, Texas and other states where they've set increased rates and not once have they followed through.

Folks in this sub and /r/Minnesota were all about raising their wages when the bill passed and argued that paying these drivers a livable wage was more important than the cost to those who use the service. As soon as Walz vetoed it then they flipped and go on about how disabled and low income need the service. 

First, both services still gives low income substantially discounted rides if driver pay goes up. They wouldn't pay more, just everyday users.

Secondly, disabled folks get their rides covered by the state. If the price of Uber goes up because we pay drivers a livable wage, it just means they charge the state more. Walz could easily put more into the budget for such. They also have access to services like Metro Transit and Metro Mobility, along with taxi vouchers. And if you're going to argue ""What about those outside the metro?"", recognize that most rural communities don't have Uber and Lyft.

Walz needs to stop surrendering to big money. Giving in to Uber and Lyft at the expense of the drivers and giving in to Mayo at the expense of the nurses."
University of Minnesota,Every time I ride an Uber/Lyft the driver tells me how they’re getting paid less and less
University of Minnesota,"Just an FYI, Minneapolis taxi drivers have their rates set by the city, and they currently are $2.50 per mile/42 cents a minute.

In contrast, our esteemed Mayor Frey feels that $1.41 per mile/50 cents a minute is WAY too much. Even at those rates, rideshare drivers will be FAR below the poverty level."
University of Minnesota,Who the heck can afford an Uber or lyft anyway these days?
University of Minnesota,"The Minneapolis City Council has resurrected plans to raise wages and expand the rights of Uber and Lyft drivers — and the companies have resurrected their threats to leave town if those plans move forward.

The battle, strikingly similar to one that played out last year, sprang anew before a Minneapolis City Council committee Tuesday. The subject of a public hearing was a proposed ordinance that would pay drivers a minimum of $1.40 per mile and 51 cents per minute while transporting riders on any trip within the city limits, among other guarantees.

Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed a similar plan last year. The primary difference this year could be political math: Following last year's election, the council has shifted slightly left, and it's possible the current council could override his veto where the last council didn't — if things head that way.

Tuesday's hearing featured a parade of drivers showing screenshots of their apps supporting their basic argument: They get paid far less than most riders realize, and their earnings have fallen steadily in recent years as the global rideshare companies take larger cuts of fares."
University of Minnesota,"It seems that then city council wants to run Uber/Lyft out of the city so those of us that can’t drive will be forced to use metro mobility, or the local taxi companies, which are unreliable for on demand rides. Or use the damn light rail and inhale some 2nd hand fentanyl smoke. 

And if we object, we are just blinded by a “false consensus” instilled by the ruling class and elites."
University of Minnesota,Call their bluff. Fuck em.
University of Minnesota,"It's amazing to me how otherwise ""liberal/left"" people get turned into laissez-faire capitalists when it comes to this issue

uber/lyft shouldn't have this stranglehold on our society and they should have to pay drivers fair wages."
University of Minnesota,"Call the bluff. If they leave they leave. Some drivers will go to traditional taxi companies, some might start their own company, some will work for a black car service, and some will get non-driving jobs. 

It wouldn’t be the end of the world."
University of Minnesota,"If I'm doing my math correctly.

They want Uber/Lyft drivers to average $35-$53/hr.

That cost transfers over to riders.

It doesn't seem like a realistic business model."
University of Minnesota,Has anyone been receiving insane amounts of promos from Uber lately? I wonder if it has anything to do with this ordinance.
University of Minnesota,"Many many people in the dorms don’t own a car. I sure wouldn’t at UMN. Parking is usually far away. Far enough you won’t want to deal with it versus walking. I had a car during college and 3/4 times it was used after October was to make sure it had not been stolen or broken into, and that it still started. Everything else was by bus, bicycle, or on foot.

Dorm life can be done largely indoors or within the campus area or dinkytown in general."
University of Minnesota,"If you’re in a dorm, then no need for one. Even then, you can get most places with ride share, hour car rental, bicycles (and if you get an e-bike, you can carry groceries and stuff), mass transit or walking.  And then you don’t have to worry about parking, snow days, insurance, etc.

And welcome to the Cities!"
University of Minnesota,No.  The light rail runs thru campus. A car would be a burden.
University of Minnesota,Ride a bike
University of Minnesota,"It's definitely not necessary. You can get anywhere you need to without a There is a Target Express in Dinkytown where you can get most essentials within walking distance. If you don't mind public transportation you'll have no issues getting around. The rideshare apps in the cities are also very reliable, fairly cheap and can get you where you need to go. 


However, if you plan to visit home frequently or need to drive outside of the cities a car can be very nice to have. It just gives you an additional level of freedom. However, parking on campus at the University lots is expensive and you have to be lucky enough to be selected for the parking lottery. 


Depending on where you live on campus, you can find monthly parking options, but this typically costs ~$100 a month. Some of the houses and older apartment complexes can have cheaper parking options. If you use your car frequently enough, street parking in the surrounding neighborhoods can be doable but can be very inconvenient in the winter months. This also depends on what area you live in. Como and Marcy Holmes will be better for parking. When I lived in Marcy Holmes (a neighborhood within walking distance of campus) I parked on the street and it was manageable, but I also drove to work most days so it felt worth the hassle. (I also got a few parking tickets in this timeframe but still cheaper than campus parking)


If you are coming in as a freshman, I recommend sucking it up for your freshman year. Live the car free life, enjoy it. And then choose an apartment with off street parking the next year."
University of Minnesota,"No, you don't"
University of Minnesota,"Where is your gf? You won’t need one to get around campus. You’ll walk, bike, scooter, bus, etc. because they are easier/cheaper than finding parking close to wherever you need to be."
University of Minnesota,"You can have a car if you want one there. You'll be very popular as one of the fewer students with one. But listen, having a car in the winter in Minneapolis is going to be a huge, huge PITA. You not only have to deal with the snow and clearing off your car and running it regularly and all of that, but you can't really park on the street and have to move it every day for the plows.

My youngest tried having a car at the UofM for about three months before he just gave up and sold it. Way too much hassle for how little he used it."
University of Minnesota,"If you don't have a car, expect to walk at least a couple of miles a day.

If you do bring a car, expect to walk at least 10 miles a day."
University of Minnesota,"I went to the U from 04-08 and never had a car. I lived in the dorms freshman year, downtown Mpls sophomore and junior year, and dinkytown my senior year. A majority of my classes were on the St Paul campus. It wasn't bad at all, and public transit wasn't nearly as robust back then either. I'd say it was way easier to not have a car."
University of Minnesota,You’d save a ton of money by using a Uber o Lyft on the weekends to get to your gf’s house. The U has a transit pass integrated into their ID now and you can ride buses and light rail for free.
University of Minnesota,"No, but you do need a bike."
University of Minnesota,"When you're in the dorms it would not be fun to have a car. Nowhere to park and you genuinely don't need one (easily bike-able/walkable area and good transit). If you move off campus into como for your sophomore-senior years then maybe there could be a reason to get a car for groceries and what not but it's still super easy to bus/bike to campus. If you're living in one of the new apartments near campus, there's no real reason to have a car for the high parking costs"
University of Minnesota,"I did not have a car when I lived in the dorms on West Bank, and would not recommend. That was even before the light rail running through campus...  


I eventually moved to a suburb and used the car to commute to campus and it felt like I pulled a golden ticket for parking on the West Bank. But I was using it literally every day to commute, so the car payment, gas, insurance payments, and parking expense was, at the time, worth it. I would gently encourage you to consider those costs as well."
University of Minnesota,Definitely don't go home every weekend
University of Minnesota,"The are short term car rental services on campus as Zipcar and Hourcar. You can rental a vehicle for a few days or hours and insurance is covered as part of membership fees. 

Check with the [University's parking and transit office](https://pts.umn.edu/Transit/Transit) for more information."
University of Minnesota,"Unnecessary to have one. I’ve been fine for 4 years! Transit is great, take advantage of it, the cost for Ubering places that you can’t get transit to is WAY cheaper than car maintenance and more importantly PARKING. Sooo expensive and such a hassle on the U campus"
University of Minnesota,"Do you *need* a car today? Probably not.

Will you *want* a car in two months when it's 10 below and there's two feet of snow on the ground? Definitely. 

That said, the only thing better than having a car in the winter is having a friend who has a car in the winter. 

I went to the U in the hazy mists of the prehistoric era, but from what I gather it's much easier to get around campus indoors than it used to be. I have no idea if the old tunnels are still open, but those were a godsend. I had a motorcycle that I could park for free in certain areas\* that helped a bunch, but you can't carry groceries or go anywhere in the rain with it.

Good luck, welcome to the cities and YMMV."
University of Minnesota,"As others have said, you definitely don't need one your first year or two. However, you said you'll be in CSE, so if you get an internship or co-op you could find a car useful. Most engineering companies are not on campus or downtown and our public transport system isn't the greatest for getting to the suburbs."
University of Minnesota,"If you want to get around fast, and not have to worry about gov't, or bus strikes, then yes. 

If you don't mind taking the longest, most asinine way to get somewhere, then go for it"
University of Minnesota,"Different area of town, but I don't drive nearly as much as I did before moving here, and if I really wanted to could almost entirely live without a car. I'm sure it's possible."
University of Minnesota,The campus is very easy to get around and ride share will be your best bet. No need for a vehicle unless you're working off campus a ton
University of Minnesota,"I'm not even a student and I didn't have a car until COVID.  Between Metro Transit, friends, and Uber/Lyft, it's not a need here.

The only reason I bought a car during COVID is because I didn't feel safe taking the other options because I didn't want to get sick.  

For anything you need though, as a student, you will be fine."
University of Minnesota,Auto insurance here is amongst the highest in the country -especially if you live in core areas of the city.   You don't need one to get around the cities but if you want to go somewhere very early or very late it will be an issue
Michigan State University,"Yep it’s safe, a lot of the drivers you get in EL are from Lansing anyways."
Michigan State University,My spouse drives Uber & Lyft overnights around campus. Very safe 🙂
Michigan State University,"I never had a bad experience with an Uber/Lyft driver during my time at MSU. The only time I wouldn’t count on a ride being available would be really early in the morning, like 3-4 am. Speaking from experience 🫠"
Michigan State University,I've even been able to find Ubers at 6:00 AM from the morning after (granted I had to wait a bit) but there's def drivers!
Michigan State University,"there are plenty of drivers out at that time.  and depending on the day and where you are, you could take the 1 bus.  it runs pretty late."
Michigan State University,"i’ve taken an uber 4 times, twice to/from the hospital and it was fine. another leaving a guys dorm- very nice old man, and then another time leaving a party. they always were respectful and safe"
Michigan State University,"It’s safe, just expensive! College town weekend nights during events = price rides"
Michigan State University,"Highly suggest looking at the bus routes, it’s only 60 cents one way for students, even if you only take it to get to the event and Uber back you’ll save a lot of money."
Michigan State University,"Its safe! If you live on campus too, you can call safe ride (8pm-2am) or night owl(2am-6am) and thats for sure safe as well"
Michigan State University,"The sub is a driver's sub and is not sponsored, endorsed, or officially monitored by Uber."
Michigan State University,I was there at MSU driving and I strongly believe the suspect could have used rideshare to get to Lake Lansing/Larch. The shooter also looks familiar. I hope they check to see if he had a rideshare account.
Michigan State University,"Ubers stance:

We completely care about you and your riders. 

If you refuse too many rides, you will be deactivated!

Uber is like the honey badger…. They don’t give a fuck."
Michigan State University,Who are you talking to?
Michigan State University,Michigan Flyer. They pick you up in East Lansing by the Marriott and drop you off at the airport.
Michigan State University,"As the responses above have stated, Michigan Flyer is your best bet. I recently used it last weekend to get to Campus from DTW. There is wifi, a bathroom and it’s honestly a relaxing ride. I paid $32 for my ticket."
Michigan State University,mainly Michigan flyer; but sometimes it’s cheaper to buy a flight ticket starting from LAN with a stop at DTW; LAN is 20 mins Uber away from the campus.
Michigan State University,"Not to be a Debbie downer but automated cars are a LONG way off in the the United States. Our roads are trash and honestly with how frequently google maps gets the routes and speed limit on roads wrong I wouldn’t trust An automated car.

I honestly cannot see automated cars and humans driving on the same roads. I think if we want automated cars on the roads they need their own lanes. Some states may be able to do that, but a state like South Carolina that’s never going to happen without massive change to our elected officials, policy makers and quite honestly our outdated infrastructure. 

Best of luck on your study."
Michigan State University,I filled out the survey but personally think fully automated vehicles are a long way off and only good for owners and the same people who already control everything.
Michigan State University,"Hi Everyone,   
The study is still collecting responses. If you'd like to participate, please visit the following link to the survey: [https://msu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV\_6Ye406mYoWZy72e](https://msu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6Ye406mYoWZy72e)"
Michigan State University,Survey started off asking to many personal questions so I backed out. None of the first 10-15 questions i answered was about automated cars.
Michigan State University,Michigan state university survey using a gmail? Weird
Michigan State University,won’t pay out anyways
Michigan State University,"How do you plan to not hit cyclists the way Uber did?

otherwise what's your margin of error - 7 per month only 77 per month only? And what if it's a child cyclist where do they fit in

Thanks 🙏 taking notes on your killer robots for a future medium article when you kill someone"
Michigan State University,"Replacing Drivers with autonomous Vehicules is not exactly what I would call ""preparing the future  workforce""."
Michigan State University,Debbie Downer Phx already has Autonomous cars on the road but we are pretty progressive. You can get a car with no driver to pick you up just like Uber
Michigan State University,"https://www.michiganflyer.com/

This bus stops one block north of campus."
Michigan State University,"Seriously, take the Michigan Flyer."
Michigan State University,https://preview.redd.it/5h2rsf8bvg2b1.jpeg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=11cd09ad19c627d2a6ebd5bcc8236eec24c327ba
Michigan State University,Welcome to Michigan and MSU!
Michigan State University,"The cab cost me 120 ish during spring this year but yeah, the bus (Michigan flyer) is your best bet."
Michigan State University,"The flyer is 30 dollars and drops you off a 5 minute walk to campus.

Take it."
Michigan State University,check your msu email for the weekly intl newsletter and sign up for the free shuttle provided by msu from detroit airport
Michigan State University,"Hey buddy,

  
Don't take an uber or cab. Use the Michigan Flyer or Grey hound buses. It is much much cheaper. Welcome to Michigan :)"
Michigan State University,around $140
Michigan State University,"Welcome to michigan.  Detroit and msu are 1h 30m apart and uber cost will be very very very expensive for that distance. Like the other ppl said, look into bus options - there’s michigan flyer and greyhound as far as I know."
Michigan State University,"If you have a preplanned long trip that goes from one larger city to another then you should *definitely* look into bussing, everyone else is saying Michigan Flyer!

If two cities are sufficiently large there’s likely to be a market to schedule bus routes between them, Lansing and Detroit definitely fit that criteria. I know my brother took an Amtrak(?) train to Chicago from EL. Just always go with a scheduled mass transit route to save money!

The only reason you pay an Uber’s premium cost is because it’s on demand and for short distances, this is preplanned and very long and as such the game has changed."
Michigan State University,Use Michigan flyer~ there are wifi and charging available on the bus.
Michigan State University,I am always here to support the Michigan Flyer pile-on
Michigan State University,Pretty sure msu provides transportation for incoming international students
Michigan State University,"I would not do either. I would fly into Lansing. See if you can get a flight from Detroit to Lansing. I’ve done that once. It’s a little puddle jumper of a plane but it will take you there. Then, use an Uber."
Michigan State University,"it’s better to take the flyers, an uber will be too expensive"
Michigan State University,"Uber/Lyft driver here. DTW to MSU (or vice versa) ranges from $115-150 depending on how busy it is when the ride is requested. 

I second what others have said, the Flyer is a great option unless you have money to burn."
Michigan State University,"Watch out for info from OISS, I’m reasonably sure that last year they had some kind of accommodation for freshman international students"
Michigan State University,"as others have said, just get a michigan flyer.  its 32 bucks, and leaves every 2 hours so you won't be waiting around too long to get one and it's quick enough.  it stops in ann arbor and brighton along the way, but when I took it last, there were no passengers getting on or off in brighton so they just skipped it.  took maybe 1.5 hours?"
Michigan State University,"Apparently there’s a sign up sheet for free transportation but for any other time use the Michigan flyer, sooo much cheaper than an Uber"
Michigan State University,"what everybody else said, take the michigan flyer. i live on the east coast and take it every time i fly home or back to michigan"
Michigan State University,I'm looking for a driver right now... but it doesn't seem like anyone is available.
Michigan State University,"As an occasional rider (to/from the airport or Michigan Flyer), I'm almost always surprised how cheap the rides are. I can't understand how it's worth it for the drivers around here (besides game days)."
Michigan State University,"If you want to drive, usually the times of most demand are in the morning like 7:30-10  fares are usually 1.5x or 2x.  I use lyft or uber at least twice a week in the winter to get to work cause i don't want to deal with the buses or riding my bike.  Game days are of course very lucrative.  I've seen up to 7x surges."
Michigan State University,"If you’re looking to make a living off of it, not really. I’d advise doing it for fun, and to make some good money on game days and weekend nights around MSU."
Michigan State University,"I just happen to see your post and I made a video on this subject last week. Feel free to check it out and ask any questions I didn't cover. 
Thanks,

Michigan State University,"Google two party consent states. If Michigan is two party, you have to post notices. Post notices anyway.

Lyft doesn't care. Uber will let you register the cam and will inform pax that you have one."
Michigan State University,"Get the stickers and record everything. Stickers serve a dual purpose. They keep you legal, and it reminds the passenger you're recording, discouraging bad behavior and false claims."
Michigan State University,"It’s not illegal to record,it’s illegal to publish the footage without consent"
Michigan State University,Thank you all for the input.
Michigan State University,"Just put stickers up, they are inexpensive from Amazon. I have one on every door. At the top of the window. Can’t miss them."
Michigan State University,"Also, look up laws regarding expectation of privacy and whether that applies in a rideshare situation."
Michigan State University,"Use the Michigan Flyer: https://www.michiganflyer.com

It picks up from the Marriott north of campus and is quick and reliable and has decent WiFi so you can work while you travel."
Michigan State University,Michigan Flyer is clutch
Michigan State University,"Michigan flyer Michigan flyer Michigan flyer

So easy and so cheap"
Michigan State University,"I’ve seen an Uber cost around $150 one way from Detroit to Lansing, the flyer is def the cheapest and probably most convenient option but do be careful about late arriving flights as I believe the flyer stops after a certain time of night"
Michigan State University,Just use the flyer
Michigan State University,I’m here for the Michigan Flyer pile-on
Michigan State University,"use the flyer as you can schedule and guarantee a ride (no worry outside of winter) and it takes you right to your terminal for I think $50 round trip. keep in mind late night runs. if you’re aching to save money, you can always sleep in DTW until the flyer begins its run"
Michigan State University,"The Michigan Flyer jingle slaps, it’s on permanent rotation in my “friday night pregame” playlist"
Michigan State University,"Michigan Flyer, but don’t be late as they are incredibly punctual"
Michigan State University,Michigan Flyer but if traveling during popular times make reservations early as they sell out
Michigan State University,I use metro car pricey but drivers are professional and they track ur In bound flight and the drivers are reliable
Michigan State University,Make sure you line up your schedule correctly. The last westbound departures from DTW are 8:15pm and 8:30pm. So that west coast mid day flight doesn’t arrive in Detroit until after 10pm or a red eye will have you waiting at the airport for a few hours until they leave in the morning at 7:15/7:30am.
Michigan State University,you could just bum a ride to the nearest train station and take it up to lansing
Michigan State University,"If you are able, I would rent a car. Otherwise, the flyer is your best bet"
Michigan State University,"I literally just got an Uber from downtown EL to Lansing right after the MSU basketball game today, cost $12 and was as speedy as if Covid never happened.  The dude did have a plastic wrap wall in between us and him, but I couldn’t tell if that was because of Covid or puking msu students.  He was nice too."
Michigan State University,"I have not had any issues working Lansing or East Lansing.  I live a few miles out of town and it’s been hit or miss if there a driver available for pickup. 

Edit: I only have the Uber app, never needed to have Lyft. Yet."
Michigan State University,"Just depends on your timing, but yes, drivers are definitely back."
Michigan State University,"yep!  sometimes it can take a while (like 20-25 minutes from asking for a ride to getting in a car) but you can get a ride.  i found sometimes that if lyft is taking a while, uber is faster and vice-versa, but not always."
Michigan State University,if you don't drive drunk you won't get a DUI
Michigan State University,I live downtown and I do see them around as well as East Lansing.
Michigan State University,"They've been around for awhile now, they'll take you anywhere."
Michigan State University,"I use them almost every day during the week in the morning.  When you get closer to 'work' hours like 8am or 9am they can take longer.  Usually if youre 15-20 mins before the hour you can get a decent time, otherwise you'll be waiting at least 10-15 minutes."
UMich,[deleted]
UMich,"App looks terrific..I just had a question, why did you have “seasons” on the app? Can a user not use MPool sometime other than a break?"
UMich,Great initiative. Thinking of making it accessible for non M students/alumni?
UMich,App looks great and already made a request. Minor but just noticed that North Quad isn’t on the list of dorms
UMich,"If I’m going to the airport but it isn’t for Spring Break, how would I make that request?"
UMich,Really cool app! I would have totally used this in previous seasons :))
UMich,This is so great! I wish you lots of luck.
UMich,this is an awesome idea. was having an issue scheduling flights around the michigan flyer schedule
UMich,Michigan Flyer bus takes you from downtown right to the terminal and costs $15...
UMich,"You know, the airport taxi services already fill this niche of planning ahead and for example Stadium Taxi costs $54 for students with an mcard."
UMich,I think MFlyer is still such a good option
UMich,[deleted]
UMich,"This is so cool! I’ve noticed on the app that I’ve been matched with the same person 4 or 5x m, even though our leaving times don’t add up."
UMich,Please tell me how you are only paying 24 dollars/week for your rental?  Here in GA it is like 169 a week before taxes/fees.  Is that renting it per the day or what?  I'm definitely missing something lol....
UMich,It will say in the app in express drive section. I don't use it but I looked at it before and the cheapest rental in my area is $44 for 120 rides week it's probably around the same number of rides.
UMich,"If you started renting after 9/9 you don’t get rental rewards. If you have them, go to your dashboard and they’ll be at the bottom."
UMich,Ok thanks I’ll check
UMich,WTF!?
UMich,"The short answer is no, it's not reliable. 

The reservation system is terrible for riders and drivers alike. For airport rides from Ann Arbor, a scheduled ride will pay the driver roughly ~$30.00.  Drivers are required to be online 40 minutes before the scheduled time and the system forces them to arrive there 15 minutes prior to the departure time. If the rider is ready to leave, that can work out great but otherwise the driver has to sit there (earning no extra money because $30 is a flat fee). 

The entire reservation system is a money loser for drivers. First, you are giving up any rides that you can give during the 25ish minutes prior to departure time of the scheduled ride. Second, taking a reservations mean you are locked in to that flat fee. If there is a surge (which there often is) during the early morning hours, you will lose out on that. For an example, drivers can get an airport ride in the morning with a surge that will pay out $50+ while those who took the reservations will be stuck with only $30. 

As a result of all this, drivers rarely take reservation rides. But the app gives the impression to riders that their reservations have been matched with a driver when that is usually not the case. In turn, riders rely on having a ride when they probably don't which is terrible for them. In the end, if your reservation isn't matched, you will just be part of the regular request pool but the availability of drivers that early in the morning does not meet the requests hence the high surges."
UMich,I wouldn’t do it. I’ve had an scheduled Uber early in the morning and had to scramble to find a black car to drive me to the airport because my Uber that I had scheduled the day before didn’t show up and Uber has no way to resolve this problem so early in the morning. They tend to be very few drivers available before the morning commute time.
UMich,"Have you looked into the Michigan Flyer? You can get picked up at Blake Transit on S.Fifth and it will go straight to the airport. It is definitely worth checking out! 

https://www.michiganflyer.com/schedule-route"
UMich,"Maybe we got lucky compared to others, but We have pre-scheduled rides two times in the past 6 months at 3:30a-4a. Both were Lyft. Once for me, once for my wife, for early morning flights. Both times, the driver was in our driveway at the exact time we scheduled."
UMich,"It's expensive, but MetroCars has always been a good experience for us, even with several large suitcases. Their web site is a bit of a mess, though."
UMich,"I'd use LAAD- they are great, have used them many many times https://laadtransportation.com/"
UMich,"I wouldn't do it. The only time I've successfully been able to schedule airport rides that early is in much bigger cities, as there's generally more availability, so if your scheduled driver doesn't show up, there will be a few backup options. 

I think spending a little more money and scheduling with a dedicated airport shuttle company/person is better for anything before 8am. We've used [Air One Transportation](https://airportonetransportation.com/locations/detroit-michigan-dtw/) for years and never have had issues with Richard. I know others also have their preferred company/people and will drop their recs ITT."
UMich,This question comes up once a week. 😕
UMich,"We had a driver take the fair, show up, and demand an additional $100. Thankfully we were able to drive ourselves and pay for the parking because at that point it was cheaper."
UMich,"This is such a big concern for people I’m pretty surprised. 

Lyft has taken me to DTW and from DTW several times and I almost always fly red eye and such. It’s just easier to get through airports then. 

I had one instance where I had an Uber cancel on me during a daytime need. I had a tire blow and needed to pick it up but honestly I lost my tire on my road and so I wasn’t mad, but Uber just assigns you another driver. What happens is eventually a bonus comes up for a driver to just go and do it so the fare gets grabbed fairly quickly. The loss of a user due to a poor experience of no availability in a busy area is far greater than the company can afford due to it being a giant cash sink already. 

I have better fares with Lyft and I’m a poor planner so I’ll just open the app about an hour before I need to be at the airport but there are at least 3 major taxi services for airport commuting in the area as well."
UMich,For what it’s worth I go to the airport a lot (3 times a month) and always use UBER at all hours. I always use Comfort and make a reservation ahead of time. Never once been let down
UMich,"This entire program is just another Lyft marketing campaign. I’ve watched people who got these rides, got the job were provided with ride credits for a month and a good number of them ended up getting fired. Why, because Lyfts unreliable and it all comes down to how they manage the drivers who are supposed to be independent contractors. How they cheat drivers on pay especially for scheduled rides which is what the majority of these rides will fall under more than than people discover that even if Lyft does these things an it is initially viewed as beneficial. The harsh reality is that these people  after the ride credit period was over, found themselves now paying out half their income to Lyft simply to go to work and home. No real chance to better their situation. Lyft uses these programs as a means to gain users. And these programs are largely targeted at helping minorities. How are you actually helping them by helping them get a job just so you can pay them half your money and have so little money your options are still just as limited, but Lyfts now getting paid. Lyft effectively dry pimps the drivers. And this is a not so different way to make sure the riders are left with no real other option. Being broke, it changes the way you think. Everything is a decision where your very survival is on the line. You are forced to make quick decisions that train you only look at the short term. Becoming increasingly more difficult to take a step back and view the big picture and think and plan long term. Lyft is absolutely exploiting this."
UMich,And they will make sure you wind up 5 minutes late so you don't get the job and wind up driving for Lyft.
UMich,"What Lyft is doing is a pure PR marketing scheme in order to promote themselves as a ""good"" company that cares for the poor and marginalized people."
UMich,If you can’t afford a ride in San Francisco you probably have much bigger problems than getting to an interview.
UMich,Fuck lyft bitch ass fags. Keep banning my throwaway all u want ill keep coming back. You wrong for posting that girls info

UMich,"An offer from the devil. If you do get to your interview and get the job, you will now have to rely on them to commute back and forth everyday! This is predatory marketing and they will probably just take a good chunk of your new paycheck and act like the good guys!"
UMich,I would not trust it because regardless of whether you get the job or not you will have to use Lyft in some way if you get the job you will need to use Lyft for rides daily and if you dont get the job you have to drive for Lyft.
UMich,don't do it
UMich,You get job offers and opportunities from just picking up strangers…why would i get lyft involved? Is this their way of getting rid of drivers in certain areas?
UMich,Bump

UMich,"Lyft share... Good opportunty

Lyft posted second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.02 billion which met the analyst consensus estimate, a 3.05% increase over sales of $990.75 million the same period last year.

Lyft also issued guidance, anticipating third-quarter revenue in the range of $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, versus the $1.09 billion estimate.

On Wednesday, the stock fell over 9% in response to Tuesday's earnings report. Also, several analysts updated their price targets on the stock.

Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju maintained Lyft with a Outperform and lowered the price target from $23 to $18.
DA Davidson analyst Tom White reiterated Lyft with a Neutral and raised the price target from $9.75 to $11.5.
RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson maintained Lyft with a Sector Perform and raised the price target from $9 to $12.
Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil maintained Lyft with a Neutral and raised the price target from $9 to $10."

UMich,Lyft is left over of Uber and worse
UMich,It would probably be less expensive to just rent a car
UMich,"Right now I can get to pinckney for $37.  But the return trip I can’t get even book.  I would definitely say rent a car, spend the night, carpool, or book a bus if multiple people are headed back to a2 or dtw.  Good you are thinking about this now, it really makes a huge difference for your guests if they don’t have to stress out about this or even get stranded and can make the difference between a memorable night in a great way vs a really bad way."
UMich,"Service in town is fine, I’ve never had trouble getting a ride. Getting to Pinckney *might* be an issue, are there no other guests they can ride with?"
UMich,"In town, but not the surrounding area. Try and find a car pool with other wedding guests or rent a car."
UMich,I use Uber/Lyft a lot since I have some mobility issues so I can't really walk far enough for public transit sometimes. As long as it's not very odd hours you generally won't have an issue. You may have to wait a bit since the town is pretty spread out but i almost never have an issue. Lyft seems to generally have more availability for whatever it's worth.
UMich,"It's not a big issue. There is also the bus system (theride.org), which I've found to be fairly reliable."
UMich,"I had issues with both, especially in the evenings. May mobility is a good backup, but they only operate on weekdays, during business hours."
UMich,I don’t Uber or Lyft regularly but I don’t think it’s been an issue here? If you’re visiting soon Umich is on spring break so A2 feels kind of empty right now anyways with everyone gone home or on vacation
UMich,Ann Arbor is relatively small and very walkable. You should have no problem visiting the places you’d like on foot.
UMich,I used Lyft on Monday without any issues. Took a little longer than normal to get a ride.
UMich,No issues with either that I’ve heard about. Do you have an idea of where you’d like to spend the time?
UMich,"I Uber all the time from the airport to A2, you’ll be fine. Apps lie about how quickly they’ll come but not by too much. Dexter maybe harder, idk. 

This weekend my driver said if school is not in session (like last week’s holiday) then most drivers will decline to drive to A2 bc it’s hard to pick up a new ride. 

An alternative is the take the Michigan Flyer for $15 from each terminal to downtown A2. It’s a coach bus. Tickets available online. I’ve done it a couple times it’s just the timing isn’t often convenient."
UMich,DTW to Ann Arbor or Ypsi is super easy. Dexter is a little less easy.
UMich,It will cost a little more but you can look into metro cars. It will be more reliable for sure.
UMich,"[LAAD Transportation](https://laadtransportation.com) is cheaper than Uber or Lyft which often cost about $55-$65+ from DTW to Ann Arbor one way. You can reserve your own driver for $45 with LAAD. I haven’t used them, but I know several people who have and really liked it."
UMich,It depends where in a2 but if downtown or campus probably pretty easy.  Also good bus service usually.  If a campus you can also pick up michigan blue busses for free.  Uber and lift are a lot less available when you start to get out of the core area.  If you know where you are coming from or going to just plug it in and see.  There are some good car services that are going to be more reliable from dtw.
UMich,Thanks everybody!
UMich,"I’ve gotten rides cancelled a few times from the airport to ypsi.  A kind driver who finally took me told me that airport rides *from* the airport to a quieter location aren’t as good, because it’s less likely they’ll get a good ride once they get there.   But people like taking rides to the airport because they’ll get another good ride again. 

I always get home eventually but like 1/3 of the time someone bails and its annoying.  This would be most likely to happen if you’re headed to dexter, least likely with Ann Arbor (biggest town). 

Depending on your situation, if you really want reliability, arrange with a driver you find online, like metro cars"
UMich,You'll get better answers from the other sub. All we see from the Lyft driver's end is high maintenance riders who couldn't tip if they wanted to. I don't think that anyone has officially told us that it's even a thing.
UMich,"It may be an add-on to your father's Medicare plan or you may already have it. You'll want to reach out to them to see if you're eligible. You won't actually be requesting the rides through Lyft yourself. You call Medicare and tell them that you need a ride, and they set it up.  


Edit: I'm a driver. I give these rides a few times a week."
UMich,Medicaid pays for almost any form of transportation for medical reasons. Medicare might be more of a hassle as they only provide certain types of transportation. It might be beneficial for you to contact the local office on aging to see if they are able to assist you in this matter.
UMich,"Ask the doctor for a prescription for transport. Once you have that you will be setting up with your local transit authority. Getting in touch with the local council on aging near you should get you all the info. If not, call the nearest hospital to get an appointment with their social services department"
UMich,"Just call your state Medicaid and\ or health insurance (Molina, priority healt etc) and say you need help getting to your medical appointments and they'll give you the number to set them up. Access2care transportation is who they're using now at least in Michigan through my Molina Healthcare. I'm on SSI and Medicaid in Michigan. I can even get rides to Ann arbor Michigan from Grand Rapids Michigan(across the state). Good luck. You can even get gas reimbursement if you can drive or someone else can drive. Also if you're in the city they'll also give you bus passes. It's extremely helpful when you can't find a way to your really important appointments."
UMich,Nice!
UMich,On my way..
UMich,Because lack of drivers in Novi. Well… maybe not anymore now that you’ve invited everyone. The battery convention was this week so major surges there.
UMich,"I've done both! They were both pretty much the same experience. In the middle of the day you shouldn't have any problems hailing an Uber/Lyft.

The taxi service I used was Stadium Taxi because they were cheaper than an Uber/Lyft. I actually had to call them last second the morning of a flight because 6am was too early to get an Uber/Lyft. They were at my door in 30 minutes, but you can also schedule in advance. This was post-corona too, so they're still definitely operating. 

[https://www.stadiumtaxi.com/](https://www.stadiumtaxi.com/)"
UMich,"Either of those options should work.  Plan ahead, leave early."
UMich,"Oh dip I thought you said 3 AM.  You said 3:00 PM.  There should be no shortage of uber drivers around that time.  If you want a shuttle service, you can consider that too, although some are still temporarily shut down:

UMich,"Reservations, reservations, reservations. Make sure you make reservations. So much has changed since the pandemic began. Many gig workers quit or found new jobs. Most rideshare drivers want to stay safe and are delivering food now only. The taxi and limo services are your best, and should be the only, option to think of for any important ride arrangements. Before the pandemic Uber and Lyft left people high and dry looking for rides at the last minute. We had to save the day for so many back then. It’s really getting old hearing about it now. It’s 100 times worse after the pandemic eased up, no one is really out working like before. Most rideshare drivers want fast money and surge prices. They sit back and wait to see red zones & don’t really care for the job. Call a service that cares about their reputation and customer satisfaction. Taxi and limo company prices are often slightly different but steady at the same rates each time you book. https://premiertaxiandlimo.com/ann-arbor-taxi-near-me/"
UMich,I have used an Uber/Lyft to get to the airport many times and had a positive experience. I believe in both apps you can schedule rides so you could reserve your ride ahead of time.
UW Madison,"I took an Uber around 4:30AM in mid-April and found a driver quickly. Had tried booking a cab through Union the day before but they had no availability

I was definitely nervous all night that I'd get a ride so you have to factor that in. Would have gladly paid double for the peace of mind of a guaranteed ride"
UW Madison,"I've been able to schedule a Green Cab beforehand for early early flights - less early ones I actually prefer taking the bus out there, it's longer but going from downtown to the airport for the low low cost of ""I have a bus pass"" is p great.

My suggestion: try scheduling a taxi, and if (like the other commenter) they don't have availability, then go for an Uber/Lyft. It might actually be cheaper to get a real cab, tbh"
UW Madison,My scheduled Ubers have always showed up at the earliest time frame if not earlier for me. I have also called an Uber at 4 am before and they showed up in 5 mins.
UW Madison,Works great
UW Madison,"I scheduled ahead for a Lyft to be picked up at around 4:30am to go to the airport once. I did it in advance because I was worried there wouldn't be any Lyfts around at that time. I don't know when they send out the request for the ride as I got the notification that someone accepted my ride request the night before. They arrived about 10 minutes earlier than I requested which worked out fine for me as I was already good to go. My friend who was riding with me checked Uber/Lyft while we were going and this guy was the only one active. In fact, another group we were meeting at the airport had to wait for him to finish our ride before they could get picked up."
UW Madison,"it’s a hit or miss. i usually stay at a friend’s house (close to campus like on university ave) till around that time. sometimes i find a driver but they’re usually far away (have to wait for around 10 to 15 minutes). sometimes i don’t find a driver though and i end up walking home.
the schedule ahead feature is useless if you’re planning a trip during a time when usually there are no or very little drivers. i’d definitely recommend booking a cab or taxi if you have to be somewhere at that time since it’s a much safer bet even though it’s a tad more expensive."
UW Madison,"If they are so bad, I would have expected a large collection of angry customer testimonials..."
UW Madison,You're such an obvious shill it's funny. Make it less obvious by posting on Reddit about things that aren't opposing taxi services to you every once in a while.
UW Madison,"I'm an alum and I use Uber whenever I visit Madison even though I know it's illegal. The cabs were always terrible when I was on campus. Took forever or never showed up. My remaining friends in Madison still complain about the same stuff and have switched to Uber. I am in that group of people who just want to get across town. It's mainly about service. That being said, I would gladly choose the local cab companies and even pay more over using Uber if the cabs provided something close to the level of service I get when I use Uber, but it's not even close. Frankly, often in Madison it's like they don't even want my business. I don't know if they are going to take forever or just not show up when I'm trying to get to the airport or to a meeting. This is especially true if I need to call one on the fly that I haven't pre-scheduled. I understand they may be busy, but I still need to get across town.

I also have to say that the argument about safety seems a little disingenuous to me. I have definitely felt a lot less safe in cabs then I have during my experiences with Uber drivers. The cab insurance issue is also not going to move me when I'm trying to get to the airport on time. I freely admit to being pro-Uber right now, but honestly I would love to support the local cabs. Maybe things have changed and I need to give them another shot. Basically, at this time the Uber service simply seems so superior to me that I will readily break the law to use it over the Madison cab companies."
UW Madison,"I don't *want* to be a dick, because I like activism and try to promote it on principle.

But Uber and Lyft are pretty damn great services."
UW Madison,"I have changed my mind on the subject of whether or not these services should be allowed. If you are willing to put yourself at risk as either driver or rider, go for it. Just realize what you're getting yourself into and accept the consequences. I feel most sober people will continue to choose licensed cabs.
Personally I would much rather see these cab companies using the same technology. What's stopping Green Cab, Union Cab, Badger Cab, and Madison Taxi from being trackable on an app? "
UW Madison,I’ve found that Lyft is generally cheaper than Uber. If it’s during surge times Green Cab can actually be cheaper sometimes and I think they also have an app
UW Madison,"The big decider for me is always availability. Open the apps and look at price,  but a wait time of 5 vs 45 is a big deal."
UW Madison,Cab every time. Drivers making a living wage is important.
UW Madison,"Woman here, I hate cabs with a passion. Lyft and Uber are both fine, just check both to see which is cheaper before you pick one. Drivers can’t drive if their rating drops below a 3.0, so most drivers are pleasant to ride with. You’ll get the occasional crazy or bad driver, but I haven’t seen any since moving here and I exclusively use Lyft or Uber to get around when I’m not biking."
UW Madison,"I ran into this problem over the weekend. I was trying to go from downright to the East Towne area at about 1 am Friday night (Saturday morning). That's usually a $15 trip on Uber. At that time, it was reading $60. (Which I thought was ridiculous considering none of the bars in the area were that busy, so the demand couldn't have been that high.) I looked at the Union Cab app, and they were reading $35. I mentally said no to both, so I started walking down East Wash.

I ended up walking all the down to First before the surge broke on Uber ($15). When I looked on UC, it was still reading $23. It was reading $25 at Festival, whereas Uber was still reading ~$40/45. Right now (1 pm, Tuesday afternoon), going from East Towne to downtown costs $15 on Uber, $28 on UC.

Conclusion: Cabs will generally have a lower price ceiling during high-traffic times/areas, but Uber/Lyft have a lower price floor."
UW Madison,"Lyft was cheaper than Green Cab in August. But, I ended up going with Green Cab because I could actually schedule it in advance and get a reliable window of when to expect someone. When I tried to schedule a morning ride in advance with Lyft, there was a 40-minute ""maybe you will be picked up"" window. It was $17 (not including tip) to go from downtown to (near) MATC with Green Cab or $14 (no tip) with Lyft.  The trip wasn't cheap but I didn't want to take my cat on the bus, lol.  I also felt a little better using a local company rather than Uber/Lyft which doesn't treat their employees well. 

If you ride the bus, you should definitely have a mask. I still see people getting on without.  I also think it is worth taking hand sanitizer with you since you will touch common areas."
UW Madison,Preference for Union cab! Think local..
UW Madison,"When I need to use it, I prefer to use Uber. It's less expensive than using the cab. 

I can't say how Lyft compares, but either of those are always better than the cab."
UW Madison,"uber and lyft are typically cheaper than a cab. the price between uber and lyft is typically pretty similar, unless one is surging and the other isn’t. regarding safety, i personally prefer lyft. i’ve always seemed to have better drivers and better overall experiences with lyft."
UW Madison,"If you have a smart phone and link them both to google maps, I believe you can compare the costs of Uber vs Lyft for a specific ride. Search for directions in google maps for your destination and you should be able to select a tab that will show both prices, or at least a cost range."
UW Madison,"Green cab. Make an appointment ahead of time.

Green isn't great for normal calls because they're slow, but they are local and, of course, green"
UW Madison,"A lot of drivers drive for both. I once asked a guy driving if he had a preference and he said ""nah, you should just go with whatevers cheaper."""
UW Madison,"Personally, I prefer Lyft, but I just order from whichever one is cheaper at the time!"
UW Madison,i’ve used uber many times and have never had an issue
UW Madison,"I'd go with the one that offers current pictures of the drivers. I took an Uber several months ago and the driver had a big beard and affable, hearty laugh.  Would have been a pleasant drive in normal times but since his mask didn't seal anything I could imagine the virus being sprayed back at me through his beard each time he chortled.  Also, at one time I read Lyft was equipping some drivers with plexiglass walls, don't know if that happened in Madison but would definitely be a plus to be isolated from each other."
UW Madison,Check each app before every ride. The answer is that it varies
UW Madison,"For scheduled rides Uber requires the driver to be online 45 minutes before the ride, and won’t give them any other rides during that time period.  That is what you are paying for with a scheduled ride."
UW Madison,"Weirdly enough, for a while I found Lyft was massively more expensive than Uber here. I usually just check both each time I need a ride since I never know which one is fleecing me otherwise."
UW Madison,This is why I always check both :) Usually they're within 20% of each other price-wise but every so often I'll see some insane differences like this. And it's not always one being more expensive than the other.
UW Madison,"Supply and demand. Sometimes you can't even get a ride with one or the other. I have both and always check both, for pricing and wait times"
UW Madison,"Lyft is consistently cheaper than uber whenever I try to use a ride service, either at home or on vacation"
UW Madison,"Capitalism. 

Each service has a certain number of drivers and competing demand at any given time."
UW Madison,"Both platforms offer quotes before actually matching the driver to the rider.  You likely would have waited a lot longer for the Lyft ride than the Uber ride. The Lyft ride may never have come, and could have gotten repriced before you could actually get picked up."
UW Madison,"I only did it for a total of around 120 hours for Uber, but I averaged around $12-15. Bar time one night I made $40 per for two hours, but by the time I made my last drop off at 3:45a, I was 35 mins from Madison. "
UW Madison,"I did Lyft as a supplemental job for a few months - some stray observations:

- only peak hours for Lyft are weekday mornings, Friday/Saturday nights, or during major events (Epic UGM, Dairy Expo, Badger football games). If you can't drive those hours, forget about getting any bonuses

- airport is not worth the wait in most cases, since cabs are allowed to line up, while rideshares have to sit in the cell phone lot. Waiting 30 minutes for a ride that may only net you $10 isn't worth it.

- bar time can be profitable, but holy crap driving on University/Johnson/Gorham near campus is dangerous. There's no safe spots to pull over on the major roads except for that block in front of Karaoke Kid/Double U. 

- You're better off picking a spot on either the west side, taking hotel guests to and from downtown, or on the east side, as it tends to be under-served by drivers

- In short, if you need some cash, there are worse gigs, but don't expect much.

- FYI the best night I ever had was the night of The Chainsmokers concert at the Alliant center. It was a perfect mix of a Friday night, during rush hour, and it was pouring rain. From 3:30-6 pm I did nothing but drive carloads of UW kids to the arena, all on a 2x surge or better. After the concert, between 9-11 pm, I got two rides back to campus at 5x and 6x. I raked in $350 over five hours of driving. But that was a HUGE outlier, and I never got anything half that good again."
UW Madison,I worked the spring of 2016 while I was between jobs. Usually worked about 50 hrs a week making between $600-$700 per week. I like working the commute times 6-10am & 3-6pm. I liked the brunch rush Saturday & Sunday morning too between 9-12. Never really felt it was worth my time doing the bar close shift as the job is so inconsistent. Missing the surge rates and getting stood us sucks
UW Madison,"It’s not worth it, especially if someone pukes in the vehicle"
UW Madison,"Usually around $15/hour. I’d imagine drivers who drive during bar hours might earn more, but I’m not willing to deal with the drunk frat bros on State St. "
UW Madison,"Before moving to Madison I would Uber (Lyft a little) and I made decent supplemental income. Nothing to survive on. But my city was about 25% University so there was always demand. After moving to Madison I tried it for a little but over Christmas break when I was off work. Wasn’t what I was expecting from a city with 10x the population. I made about $15/hr.  Not worth it in my opinion, I’ll take my free time. I tried the airport, you might wait 30 minutes for a 30 minute ride and then made $15. Out of 4 rides I did one day, I got $6 in tips I think. Nothing spectacular. "
UW Madison,"I drove when both first came into Madison, and was an “ambassador” for Lyft.  That meant I was part of a small group that on boarded new drivers.  I’m not sure if they still do this or if it has become automated, but look into the training / recruitment aspect.

Basically when someone wanted to become a driver, you would get a notification.  They would drive to you and you’d do things like show them how to use the app, take their photo, take photos of their car, etc.  The process took about 30-45 mins and I believe you got $75 each time if I remember correctly.

Additionally, if I recruited someone - say one of my passengers wanted to become a driver.  I’d set up the training with them and get the $75, then if they stuck with it and completed x amount of rides in the first month, you’d get something like $250-$500.

So doing the actual driving, I’d estimate about $15 net an hour like others mentioned, but I made the most money with very little time or effort through the training program.

Like I said, they may have gone away from this program, but maybe worth asking about."
UW Madison,"I drive for green cab sometimes, and I average $16/hour after paying all cab lease fees and gas for the night. Friday and Saturday night you can do 20-25. "
UW Madison,"All the posts here so far quote revenue, but expenses.  Estimate something like 30 to 50 cents per mile."
UW Madison,Be aware that this week is Epic UGM so there's going to be a LOT of people visiting the area. It might be harder to get a Lyft/Uber or Cab in general.
UW Madison,I'd call Union Cab instead.
UW Madison,See if your hotel has shuttle.
UW Madison,It would make more sense to prebook a cab. Union Cab will definitely pick you up that early
UW Madison,Hey guys thank you! i will book a union cab for this. This subreddit is awesome!
UW Madison,Prebook a Lyft. That way you're almost guaranteed to have a ride.
UW Madison,"For early morning stuff, Union Cab is the most reliable. I’ve pre-booked Lyfts and Ubers for morning airport drives and have had rides cancelled or had them not find a car. Union Cab’s app is easy to prebook or just call. If you’re looking for something where you absolutely have to be somewhere at a certain time like a flight or a surgery, I think that’s the safest bet. 

Ubers and Lyfts really did change the game for bar time transportation, though. I think most of the taxi haters (and I’ve been one of them) come from the 2000-early 2010s era when you’d call a cab outside the bar and it would take forever to show up or it wouldn’t show up at all (that was Madison Taxi’s specialty.) And then if you didn’t have cash and had to do a card, the cab driver would be a prick about it. Cabs are better for some things, rideshare is better for others. I’ve had mostly negative experiences with Green Cab (app crashing, rides cancelled, drivers being assholes) so they’re last on my lists."
UW Madison,"Prebook a cab.  Sometimes there’s an Uber available at that time, sometimes not."
UW Madison,Union Cab
UW Madison,Agreed! Call Union Cab the night before.
UW Madison,Union Cab.
UW Madison,Never had a problem getting a Uber home from a friends house after a night of drinking so I’d assume you’re fine
UW Madison,"I’m definitely biased as an Uber driver, but I drive from 3am-7am regularly and I’m almost never the only Madison Uber driver online, even at 4am. The airport rush starts around 4:45am so by 6am the road is usually plenty saturated with drivers.

If you do go with rideshare, and you’re concerned about getting a driver, schedule ahead of time. They will match a driver to you about 20-30m before the appointment. Yes, the driver can cancel on you and not show, but if they do, they’ll probably do it right when they get the request (not right before you’re walking out the door) and you will be priority #1 for Uber in terms of sending the next available driver- who is probably not far. I’ve probably done 250 early morning scheduled rides, and on all but 2 of them, Uber sent me early enough to get there before the scheduled departure time- even accounting for previous drivers who accepted the trip and then cancelled before I picked it up."
UW Madison,"I drive ft for Uber. Schedule the day before with what time you want. They will get you a driver for the pickup. Myself and another driver I know are out in those early times and do these often. Just if you reserve, plz be ready before the scheduled arrival time as sometimes they get us there too early and we don't really get paid to wait"
UW Madison,Prebook a ride on Uber or Lyft.  Be ready 20 minutes before the scheduled time.  I have picked up many people that said they were stood up by the cab company that early in the morning.  There are no guarantees.
UW Madison,"Wow, Union Cabistan is brigading this like Russians to a r/politics post. I’ve been on this sub for years and never seen this love for traditional cabs."
UW Madison,I’d say you’re good with an Uber but absolutely 0% change with Lyft
UW Madison,"Absolutely not.  Cars are difficult and expensive to park near campus and downtown.  I have a student who just graduated.  Spent 4 years on campus and never had a vehicle.

I'd really recommend starting out without one.  Save your money for good winter gear."
UW Madison,"You won’t be able to park anywhere near the campus and parking is extremely expensive, I would advise against having a car."
UW Madison,"walking through the snow in negative degree weather is character building. and unless you are one of the astronomically rare students who qualify for on-campus parking, you're going to deal with it regardless of your car ownership. 

there are reasons to consider owning a car in madison but it's not necessary and if you're buying one outright, I don't see it making any sense at all economically."
UW Madison,"No, not a great idea for students living on campus to have a car usually.  Parking is hard to find and expensive unless you have a parking space built into your lease.  It is nice to have for getting out of town/groceries but it is logistically very difficult to keep a car on campus.

Just make friends with someone who does have a car on campus ;)"
UW Madison,You won’t need one. I’ve lived here my entire life and I’m going to UW in the fall and definitely won’t have a car with me. Everything is pretty bike-able/walk-able but especially on campus and downtown. The campus also has its own bus service partnership with the city so in addition to Madison’s existing transit network (Which is improving a lot rn) you have super frequent service in and around campus thanks to those services. You’ll get a free bus pass as a student but also almost everything you’d do will be within walking distance from campus. Downtown and campus are also so close to each other. A car would be more of a liability especially with parking concerns.
UW Madison,"Thank you all for your valuable suggestions! I have just discovered how dumb I was after reviewing the qualifications on the university website. I should reconsider the idea of having a vehicle.  
  
I was confused by a U.S. News survey stated approximately half of college students have cars on campus, which led me to believe I might need one as well. However, it seems not applicable here.  
  
FYI, only the following people are qualified for parking on campus:  
1) Commuting students living outside Madison and beyond one mile of the city transit system   
2) Working students using their vehicle at least three times a week for employment off campus   
3) Students with unusual or special needs"
UW Madison,U can walk/bus anywhere in Madison 99% of the times. Been living here as an international student for 3 years and I’ve had to use a car a handful of times so it would be significantly cheaper to occasionally uber.
UW Madison,"Unless you’re living a good deal away from campus, you don’t need a car. Most people walk in winter, the cold is more of an annoyance rather than a crippling impediment.

Also should note even if you get a car, it’s not going to help you get to class; there’s no parking at the academic buildings."
UW Madison,"To answer your question, no you don't need a car to live in Madison. Many will tell you it's not nessesary at all and itll be more trouble to actually have one. 

That being said, I do have a car. 

I have a car for these reasons : 
- I love to cook and I prefer to get groceries off campus, like at Target at Hilldale, Walmart, Aldi, or Whole Foods. Having a car makes it easier to transport loads of things. 
- My hometown is Milwaukee and it's cheaper for me to pay for gas going and returning (about $20 for a round trip with my car) than to pay for a badger bus (which i used to do before I started driving highway and its about $30 for a round trip with a bundle or $42-50 without). 
- I like to get things in Milwaukee, im Mexican and can't get products I need from Madison a lot of the time, and there's more stores that sell things for cheap there so I find it better to use a car. 
- I like driving, and I'd prefer to pay for a parking spot than to leave my car at home for it to just sit there. 
- I make trips often and if it's something i need to do asap, I know I can use my car

Here's what i did the past 2 years: 
- I went on Craigslist to look for a parking spot. I found one for $109 for a 9 month lease near Henry Vilas Zoo. It was one of three spots outside of a duplex.
- When my lease was close to ending i decided to renew it for another year because I was going to stay over the summer. My cost per month went down to $99. 
- I was going to study abroad, so i subleased my spot to my cousin. 
- I would walk 15-20 minutes from my dorm to my parking spot. Or I would take the 44, 4, or 6 bus part of the way. To get back to campus I'd take the 44, 4, or 82. Or I'd just walk. 
- for the next school year I got an apartment that has a parking lot and i rented a parking spot on the lot for $140 a month. 

Reasons to not bring a car:
- if you are only planning on getting a parking spot on campus though the school (Campus lots), don't bring a car. It's not worth it for the price, it's super expensive. 
- if you don't already have a car, dont get one, unless you see yourself using it everyday. 
- If you dont see yourself traveling outside of Madison frequently. Students get a free bus pass each semester. You can use it to get anywhere in the city. Although I have a car, I didn't feel like driving sometimes so i would take the bus to Hilldale. 
- If you just don't want to deal with the snow/rain getting to class. Unless you have a medical condition or if something severe will happen if you're in that weather, it's not a good enough reason to justify paying for a parking spot AND buying a car. You will encounter a lot of harsh weather since it's Wisconsin, especially if you are here all 4 years.

For buying a car: I recommend Facebook marketplace. You should expand your search for beyond Madison. When I was looking for cars I found that Milwaukee had people selling for far less. Of course, there's a risk with buying things through Facebook, Craglist. Ebay etc. That's the only place I can suggest if you want to get a car under $5000.  There are LOTS of used car dealerships in Milwaukee, and I've only seen a few in Madison.  Used car dealerships will run more expensive, but will have more details on the car (car history, detailed descriptions of any issues or fixes the car had)."
UW Madison,"You will not be using your car daily and will not be able to park on campus.

If you want a car to drive yourself to the grocery store or just for out of town trips, then you might want one. It depends how often you need to leave campus. Given your low budget you might be a good fit for a car sharing program. If you're 21 you can also just rent a car for out of town trips."
UW Madison,"Students can get free bus passes, and the buses go just about everywhere (though aren't the most reliable).  Parking a car on or near campus is near impossible, and expensive."
UW Madison,"Imo no. I’ll lay out the pros and cons of having a car in Madison.

Pros:

1.	Street parking is only about $40 a year.
2.	It takes an hour to get to Walmart by bus but only a 10-15 minute drive. Walmart is much cheaper than anything on campus.
3.	You can drive to Woodmans or either of the malls which are 40+ minutes by bus.
4.	You could use a laundromat easily if your building doesn’t have one/is too small.

Cons: 

1.	Some places like around Langdon St do not have nearly enough parking spots to accommodate everyone and you might sometimes have to walk a fair bit.
2.	You’re probably paying $200+ a month if you get a loan + insurance.
3.	If you’re just going to places on campus, the buses are great and your tuition includes the bus pass so it might be more trouble to drive a couple minutes than take the bus.

I wouldn’t recommend getting a car now but if you need to drive to an internship during the summer or something, ymmv."
UW Madison,"Hey! Fellow international student here - you def do not need a car on campus. Plus as everyone has already mentioned parking is expensive. And if you ever need to go off campus, it will likely be with friends or people you know and you could easily split an uber. 

Even if that sounds unappealing because uber prices can sometimes be steep, you can use your bus pass for all routes and it's free for students since it's technically included in the tuition. West Towne mall is probably the furthest you may need to go on a monthly basis and it's just a 40 min bus ride."
UW Madison,"No. I was on campus for 5 years and I only had a car for the last year due to a co-op. Otherwise, you can get anywhere via the bus line or walking"
UW Madison,"You definitely don’t need one, there is nowhere free to park and everything is very walkable anyways! learning how to ride the bus will be helpful too"
UW Madison,Honestly a car will be an inconvenience
UW Madison,"You don’t need one.  Odds are you will make local friends who have access to one for weekend adventures but you won’t want to pay for parking and will not have much luck finding one for 5,000 that will last very long."
UW Madison,"Hey. Not really. I didn’t have one all four years I was there. Bus system is really great plus there’s always Uber if you really need it. Plus, parking is not only expensive but also very hard to find. Buy some mittens and you’ll be ok."
UW Madison,"Agree with everyone, the cost of parking alone -if you are lucky enough to find parking- makes having a car very inconvenient. Instead, I recommend you heavily invest in very good quality Winter gear: coat, boots, hats, gloves, scarfs, etc. You’ll need back ups of almost everything. Having a good quality coat and boots can make a world of difference!"
UW Madison,"No: you don’t need it whatsoever to do all student activities and live fine. parking also makes a car a liability. however, for things like buying bulk groceries and shopping, knowing a friend who has a car can prove useful."
UW Madison,No. Get a bike!!! Parking is expensive in Madison for students with cars. Bike parking is plentiful and free. The bike infrastructure here is also great!!
UW Madison,If your staying on campus or close to the campus car is not really necessary. I am also an international student and my dad offered me to buy a car but I said don't need. It's been a year since I have been in Madison and from my experience it is not necessary
UW Madison,Public transit is pretty good there and will be much easier than a car. No need for a car in a place like Madison
UW Madison,"As someone who lives off campus (20 mins away from campus) and commute every single day. There’s absolutely no benefit. I have been able to purchase a permit for the school’s parking garages. For students there are very limited options, there’s only two that are near the central campus. I paid about $1325 a year for the permit, they do not sell by months only by years but you can return the permit for a refund for the remaining days/months that’s left on the permit. This option would be the cheapest compared to other parking options. This comes down to ~$110 a month which is a lot better than what you would get renting from other places mostly around $160 a month. And it’s not very convenient, due to the limited options for student, the parking garage is about 7 mins walk away from most of my classes. So if you plan to live on campus, there’s really no need for a car. But if you plan to live off campus then it’s an option."
UW Madison,"I would only recommend a car if you can get street parking. All other parking options are too expensive unless they’re through ur landlord and even then it can run you 150-200 a month. Street parking is designated for different zones in the city, if yk where ur living id look up residential parking to see if u qualify for a street parking permit. It’s very limited and really depends on if you’re living on the outskirts of campus/downtown."
UW Madison,"I live 30-45 minutes outside of Madison, so I HAVE TO. (Me when America has no public transportation). However, if you live within, near, or on Madison Campus, absolutely not. Madison is overall more walkable than many cities, and the University area basically requires it in some sections due to how impractical driving is.

Suffice to say, probably not!"
UW Madison,"Cars have been banned on campus and the isthmus. Effective date July 1, 2023."
UW Madison,No car!!!!!
UW Madison,"Coming from where, OP?"
UW Madison,more of a headache and costly.
UW Madison,No.
UW Madison,No
UW Madison,No.
UW Madison,you dont car
UW Madison,No
UW Madison,Simple answer: no .
UW Madison,"The last time I had a very late flight I did not plan ahead and ended up waiting 45 minutes for a cab. The few Ubers that were out kept canceling my trips, and union cab had a long wait. 

Either schedule it *immediately* upon landing or call ahead."
UW Madison,"Yes and yes. The airport's last arrival isn't very late at night, so I wouldn't be worried about it. Union Cab and Madison Taxi's numbers are listed on the airport website."
UW Madison,Why wouldn’t it be safe to ride a taxi or rideshare service from the airport to campus?
UW Madison,"Yes, you can do it. However, I recommend using Union Cab. There's usually at least one waiting at the arrivals gate."
UW Madison,[deleted]
UW Madison,"Just curious, how do services like this get around the local regulations for cab services and the insurance issues?"
UW Madison,"What is the cost of the app? Is it more reasonable than a cab? Not saying cabs are unreasonable, just wondering. "
UW Madison,"I lived in Seattle for the last year and I used Lyft all the time. It's cheaper, faster, and a generally better experience than a cab. Madison is much smaller than Seattle, so it will be interesting to see if Lyft is as successful here as it is in larger cities."
UW Madison,"Two questions - 
1) No cash exchanges hands, does it mean the customer doesn't have to tip the driver?
2) I've heard of Uber before, and this seems similar. How does Lyft compare to Uber?"
UW Madison,[Lyft](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNM7Z7hir_I) can be fun!
UW Madison,"For those of you still lingering on this.

I reached out to lyfts press team. They state that they have purchased social media ads targeting over 20 different cities (including Madison) just to test the waters.

I wouldn't get my hopes up."
UW Madison,"If you wan't a free or cheap ride use promo code **HMDPDL** after your first Lyft to save $10.  If you are interested in driving, sign-up [here.](http://lft.to/1gXFsz2)  You may already be able to request a Lyft in Madison, but don't be discouraged if it doesn't match you with a driver.  It hasn't quite officially rolled out, but there are a few drivers out there certified."
UW Madison,If you want to download the app and give it a try you can use my code JUSTIN3965 and get $25 in free Lyft credits.  Just use it in the promo box of the payment section.
UW Madison,"Lyft is currently suspended from operating in Madison Wisconsin.  When you exchange money for the service of transportation, you still need to have a comercial permit in a lot of US cities.  Madison happens to be one such city.  We do not have a medallion cab system here.  this is a free enterprise system where anyone can own/operate a cab if they pay very small and reasonable fees for a permit and training.  If Lyft and uber wanted to make headway in madison, why did they try charging 20% more than the two shared ride services already in madison?"
University of Dayton,"I waited 55 minutes on a Saturday for an uber from Oakwood to Centerville / Alex Bell.  Cost 40$ lol.

Can't say I was impressed with ubers here sadly.  Unreliable and pricey."
University of Dayton,Hard to predict.  If you're talking after the airport closes there won't be many around the area.  You could test it by waking up and looking up rides through the next week to see how many cars are around.
University of Dayton,"How is your employer expecting you to get to work if they aren’t getting you a rental car?

Anyway, I agree with others that rides aren’t super reliable late at night here, downtown sure but the airport doesn’t have a ton of flights throughout the day and Uber drivers can easily check the schedule and only show up when a plane lands etc.

However, DAY does have a free airport-operated taxi service that goes city-wide. You may want to contact the airport about that.

Where will you be working at the airport? Inside or outside of security? Inside of security you’ll require credentials. Are you working construction on the ramp? That’ll require SIDA credentials. Because of these credentials I would think the airport taxi would be able to help you on a schedule even though you’re not taking a flight. Worth a shot."
University of Dayton,During the late fall and winter months you wont find an uber outside of very large events after 10pm. Dont rely on them if you can.
University of Dayton,COVID killed ride sharing in Dayton. Before the pandemic hit I used Uber in the area all the time and I'd normally only have to wait 5-10 minutes for a car. It's very different now and who knows if it will recover eventually or not.
University of Dayton,It took me an hour to find a Lyft driver the other night. Asked about it and he said most of them switched to doordash and other things like that when the pandemic started because they can make more money doing that.
University of Dayton,"I'd love to drive for Uber/ Lyft, but my car is too old, even though I keep-up on it well. So door dash it is."
University of Dayton,"There are still taxi services. No idea what rates are currently, but it's an option."

University of Dayton,"Even scheduling ahead of time, you are taking your chances for a 2am ride to the airport from the suburbs.  If you are downtown your chances improve.

On a side note, I gave up on them.  I've used them maybe five times to get home from the airport.  In every instance, the car was an absolute shitbox.  In one instance, the seatbelt didn't work.  In another, the whole backseat was stained, with, something.

I just park in the Economy lot ($5 a day)."
University of Dayton,Personally I’d rather pay the parking fee but if you’re going on an extended trip maybe that would be much more expensive.
University of Dayton,"I did this on Christmas for 3:45/4 am to go to Cincinnati airport. Scheduled a Lyft a day or so prior and it was accepted. Then the morning of I was waiting for the driver and the time passed. Lyft still had me wait but I was able to get refunded. They initially tried to find me another driver but were unsuccessful. 

Luckily I was able to get an Uber pretty fast. 

Scheduling doesn’t really guarantee you have a ride."
University of Dayton,I’ll drive you there for 40
University of Dayton,Prearrange or cab
University of Dayton,Maybe see what a taxi company charges. They may be more reliable and similar in price.
University of Dayton,You can get a fare estimate for [Uber](https://www.uber.com/fare-estimate/) of [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/fare-estimate). The cheapest option I'm seeing is $80.42 for Uber and $70-$80 for Lyft from CVG to the Dayton Mall. The actual cost will vary though.
University of Dayton,"My co-worker had the mobile # for an Uber driver that would take him to the Columbus airport fairly often. Also took him to CVG a couple of times. I'm sure there are drivers that will do it as long as the one-way fare covers them enough 'cause there's little to no odds that they'll get a rider going back the same way. Then again, they could get a rider going to some part of western Columbus to justify it.

The driver I'm referring to may not still be doing Uber though. It was 2+ years ago. 

What you could try is reserve an Uber early enough that allows you a back-up plan in case no one responds. If that driver does, tell him/her you need this same ride/trip routinely and if you can contact them directly. Might be against Uber or Lyft's rules but that's between you two...."
University of Dayton,A co worker of mine uber's and goes to cincy often and would do it probably. Hed probably do it for the fare cost of uber and cut uber out. I dont know if that helps but he's drive down there a lot. He took someone from cvg to Indy last week 
University of Dayton,"I used to drive for Uber. I don't think any driver will turn you down. I believe, at least with Uber, they are notified that the ride will be a ""long fare"" upon notification. I've taken people to CVG and Columbus and had no complaints other than having to drive back and not have any fares, but that was before Uber allowed all drivers in Ohio cities to be cross fictional between cities. I gave my personal info to a few riders who wanted a reliable person, so that's a relationship you can easily find as you do it more. 

My advice would just request the ride and send a message to the driver before they arrive where you are going, then they can cancel the ride early as opposed to being suprised by your long ride when they arrive. But again, I personally don't think many drivers will hesitate to a fare like that. 

Edit: I know with Lyft you can preschedule a ride drivers and opt into a ride ahead of time, it's shows the driver ahead of time the dollar amount for the ride so they know it will be long if the fare is high before accepting. "
University of Dayton,"I used to fly about 3-4x a month and took uber/lyft. If you are looking for an uber before 7am, you'll have to make sure to schedule it ahead of time especially if its sunday and expect to pay $90-140. I've had times where there were no uber drivers between 4-6am.

You're better off driving if you have a car and doing the economy/long term parking (~$10/day) at CVG or an offsite parking service (<$5/day). Both will shuttle you in and it might take 2 minutes waiting for the shuttle and 5 minutes to get to the terminal."
University of Dayton,hundred bucks last time i did it. in my exp whatever dollar amount you're saving flying out of cvg over dayton is basically negated smh
University of Dayton,If youre a Ud student then just ask another student with a car to drive you in exchange for a case of beer or box of bills donuts. Thats what I always did.
University of Dayton,This is why we need a train or something
University of Dayton,"Friends or family is the most economical way if not driving yourself. 
I almost always prefer to fly from Dayton, unless all the other incidental costs mean I'm saving money or time. The primary reason I fly from CVG is for a non-stop flight."
University of Dayton,Almost every taxi service will give you special rates if its to or from an airport. With clean cab taxi it's like 50 bucks from fairborn/beavercreek area to the Cincinnati airport.
University of Dayton,"Depending on how long your trip is it might be cheaper, or equal, to driving yourself and parking your car. The cheapest parking lot at cvg is $9/day. Never had a problem with it. I would easily say an Uber will be $90+.. consider both ways. I think you’d be better off driving yourself unless you don’t have a car. And besides that, being in control of when you leave and arriving back and not having to wait for an Uber"
University of Dayton,"Curious, what’s it cost to park your car at CVG?

I’m curious if the price it would take to have an Uber there and back to Dayton would be more than just driving your car parking it there during the trip"
University of Dayton,"[https://www.uber.com/global/en/price-estimate/](https://www.uber.com/global/en/price-estimate/)

Bout a hundred bucks.. tip well!"
University of Dayton,"Depending on what time you need to be at the airport, I work at CVG 5 Amazon in Hebron and commute there daily. Message me about rates."
University of Dayton,Parking is super cheap so I would just do that rather than uber...Or have a friend drive you
University of Dayton,I drove a group of students from around the Moraine Walmart to CVG and it was $76. That was before some of the new fuel surcharges were inacted though.
University of Dayton,If I didn't work Sundays I'd do it for $60
University of Dayton,I just returned from a trip this past weekend and my Uber from CVG to Dayton was $98 and change. That's about what it was on the way there too. Someone else parked their car for two weeks there and the total cost was about $270-280 or so. (\~$20/day).
University of Dayton,Do not rely on this for full time income or you’re gonna have a bad time. You’ll only hit that kind of number after expenses if you drive 50/60 hours a week at peak times.
University of Dayton,[deleted]
University of Dayton,I did it part time about 15 hours a week and was making about $300 a week before taxes and gas taken out. I was driving most of the busy Friday and Saturday nights though. I would not rely on it for full time pay or you will be sorely disappointed. It good for using up free time around a full time job. 
University of Dayton,I did instacart for two weeks. I don't think it's worth doing. 
University of Dayton,You have to hit peak times. Your sleep schedule will suffer in order to make good money. 
University of Dayton,"I did great driving in Columbus. Never out here. The only thing I got out here were drunk airmen leaving open bottles of alcohol in my backseat, which could have gotten me pulled over and in a hell of a lot of trouble. Go drive in another metropolitan area on game days though, or drinking nights, and you’ll make some decent supplementary income. Probably not enough to live on though."
University of Dayton,If you want to hear some actual stories from two drivers in Dayton OH. My wife and I run a podcast over at [sidehustlekerfuffle.com](https://sidehustlekerfuffle.com) and we discuss stories and then at the end of every episode we discuss our hours and the amount of money we made that week. You could always skip to the end to see what we've been making weekly and the hours we're putting in to do so. I'd say a rough estimate before gas and wear and tear on the vehicle... DoorDash is somewhere between $9-$12/hr and Uber/Lyft is somewhere between $15-$21 per hour in the Dayton market (currently) and again... This is before gas and wear and tear.
University of Dayton,The best museum in the area is the National Museum of the US Air Force.

University of Dayton,Complete the Dayton Ale Trail. More than 20 breweries to visit!
University of Dayton,"If possible bring or buy a bike up here.  There's a bike path right on the back side of Wright State that you can ride for miles (to include downtown which is about seven miles from there)!  Also, there are several running groups that do pub runs in the area.  Not sure about the current state of Uber/Lyft, but I've used them in the past and they seemed to be fairly responsive."
University of Dayton,"Live music, if it's outdoors and safe. National Museum of the USAF (block out two full days on your schedule for it, you'll want to, trust). Wright Dunbar Museum. Dayton Art Institute. Yellow Springs.

University of Dayton,"If you’re looking for a cheap sport to try, disc golf is great in this area.  Dayton ranks in the top 15 cities in the country for courses.  Cinci ranks in the top 10.  
HazyShade is the best place to get discs around here.  They can help you pick out something to start with.  
If you find you don’t like the sport, you’re probably only out $20-30."
University of Dayton,"There are many hiking trails, also canoeing or kayaking, and if restrictions let up there are festivals every weekend if you are willing to drive a bit."

University of Dayton,I have personally taken 2 ubers around 6-8 am with no issues from Miamisburg.
University of Dayton,Uber and Lyft are both established now and very reliable all hours of the day. Plan on ordering it about 5-10 minutes before you intend to leave.
University of Dayton,"I've done it many times, and both jobs were relatively far away (East Dayton to Needmore, and East Dayton to Miamisburg), and have never been late."
University of Dayton,I regularly use lyft as early as 4am from Kettering
University of Dayton,I use it for work meetings that start at 7 and the longest wait time I've ever had was 9 min.
University of Dayton,Next time get a private car service more reliable than Lyft/Uber hacks
University of Dayton,"Use a chauffeur service or xl black car service,, you are using the cheapest rideshare service and then complain, it doesn't matter if the driver sat on it for days and canceled,  if lyft really cared they would have up the pay high enough so that you would have had drivers scrambling to take your fare as soon as it was sent out but they don't care, if they can't make a 50 to 70 percent profit on your ride then the hell with you they have millions of other riders to meet their margins. Please use other services for time critical rides ,I know I would."
University of Dayton,"You might have paid $90 but the driver might have only been getting $9.   And that could be why the drivers didn't do your trip.  This is how rideshare works now in 2023.  You pay a craxzy amount, the driver gets a ridiculously low amount which covers gas and then is barely minimum wage and then the company gets rich (well actually they use accounting tricks to then claim they are broke after taking in $20 billion..but you get the picture) 

And when drivers point out that the low pay is why there are all these service problems riders like yourself typically get very upset and down vote them and say something like ""Don't like it?  Get another job""

But really, like it or not, it's the company who is ultimately responsible for this.  Don't shoot the messenger, eh?"
University of Dayton,"Original Poster is confusing what the customer pays to Lyft with what Lyft pays to the driver.  Of that ninety bananas, the driver sees thirty eight on a good day.  There is more than one reason why people call it ""Gr**yft**"".

If drivers had ""all power"", we would not be getting paid 1976 cab rates."
University of Dayton,"No, there is no way you can report a driver who never drove you. Nor should there be, Karen. Find another ride."
University of Dayton,"If you’re in a smaller place like Greenville SC, use a taxi. Uber and Lyft is not the best to use.

- A Greenville resident"
University of Dayton,"Your bad review should be for Lyft the company on Twitter. It has absolutely nothing to do with the individual drivers who did not provide a ride and were under no obligation to do so, even if they wanted to. Your issue is 100% with the company (Uber too) that doesn’t care enough to assure that scheduled rides work the way most people would expect."
University of Dayton,Buy a car!
University of Dayton,Suxs but move on ask a friend next time and if u have none it’s probably U
University of Dayton,"When I got to your ""all the power to the drivers"" may I suggest you try signing up and doing this for a while. You will see drivers have much less power other than being able to reject rides.

Now you may have run into a driver who have it out for Lyft and did it on purpose. He could have had some kind of emergency. he could have gotten a better ride on Uber. However, just because you pay $90 does not mean it all goes to the driver.

There really is nothing you can do but move on in life and put it in your past. next time schedule an Uber and Lyft and the first one to get there wins."
University of Dayton,"You can’t review someone that performed no services.  We are independent contractors.   Not employees.  Which is why we are paid crap and why you didn’t have a for sure ride.  
Bad reviews.  That’s your whole point of this??  
A scheduled ride is NOT a guarantee.  
And $90 USD.  Is that what you were being charged by lyft?? Caii oh se u guarantee thats not what driver earned.  
We earn 30-40-% of what you pay. 
Get it???"
University of Dayton,"Unfortunately your story doesn’t really make sense .  Unless you live on top of a mountain it takes maybe 5-10 min to get a Lyft to show up.  

The airline recommends you get to the airport like 3 hours before your flight arrives.  That’s enough time for like 20+ drivers to show up and pick you up much less for you to download Uber and try that if for some crazy reason lyft cancels on you like 10 times in a row"
University of Dayton,"If no ride takes place, you can not leave feedback.  What can you do? Suck it up and move on with your life.  Get a cab, a car service, a friend or neighbor to take you.

We are independent contractors,  and we can cancel at any time, especially on reserved rides.  You can always post your concerns here, and many drivers will laugh at you.  You can post it on crackbook... er facebook, or X/Twitter.  Again, it really doesn't matter, as no ride took place. Lyft (not lift) will not do anything other than to say, ""Sorry you weren't happy."""
University of Dayton,"Youre entirely in the wrong for wanting to leave these reviews. 

If you want a taxi or limo type service, order one. 

No Uber or Lyft driver owes you a ride under any circumstances.  Ever."
University of Dayton,I’ve  found cheap parking near the airport that turned out to be cheaper or cost as much as a as ride-share. They always have free shuttle service to and from the airport. I never use ride services when going to and from my home airport any more. I gotta imagine there’s lots near your airport you can use. Plan better next time.
University of Dayton,"The driver would have got $30 to $40 of what you paid. If the driver had to drive back empty, they would have made less than minimum wage taking your ride.

Blame Lyft. As independent contractors we don't have to take unprofitable rides, nor is there any penalty for us canceling rides."
University of Dayton,"It's cause Lyft lets every driver in your state see all the scheduled rides. And with it being a likely $35-$40 ride a driver claimed it hoping to be in the area around pickup time.  
Lyft used to let drivers see available rides only within a certain radius (like 8-10 miles) of current location, but now I can look and claim scheduled rides that are in San Francisco, while I'm in SoCal 8-10 hours away...  
It almost feels like an disgruntled outgoing app programmer made the change to put a bigger data stream onto Lyft, by allowing drivers to make much larger data requests with every refresh of the scheduled page, (which happens multiple times a minute.)"
University of Dayton,"So you want to leave a bad review because they canceled the ride and yet you have no fucking idea why they canceled???  Should I get to leave a bad review for the rider that canceled a 35.00 ride, after I had already been driving for 10 minutes???  I mean,  he's a douche nozzle right??  How dare he have something come up that he couldn't take the ride. The nerve him. 

2 hours is not enough time to get another ride?

How is this fair,  you ask?  Didn't your mom raise you that life isn't fair?  Stop your fucking whining and trying to ruin someone's job because things got a little difficult for you. Grow the fuck up!!!"
University of Dayton,Use Uber. Their reservation system is more reliable as they have more drivers available.
University of Dayton,"As a Lyft driver I don’t accept any schedule ride as pay is so bad. Lyft don’t take care of their driver and low ball them, multiple drivers need to decline your ride in order for them to raise the price a bit to attract driver and until the price is raise to a reasonable level before accepting it so it takes 10-20min."
University of Dayton,Call a cab. No driver is required to drive you for crap wages. You probably don't tip anyway
University of Dayton,"You know how unreliable these people are, you're on the same reddit I am. You hear them joke about ditching passengers and canceling rides. They're subcontractors with freedom and can do whatever they want. I wouldn't put anything mission-critical on the shoulders of someone who drives Lyft."
University of Dayton,If they accepted in advanced they should be held accountable.
University of Dayton,"NEVER and I mean NEVER , trust an Edgardo"
University of Dayton,I drive near Greenville sc. message me if you need an airport ride. We can go outside of any apps if we agree on the details
University of Dayton,"The amount of times I’ve gotten a scheduled ride, and lost it because Uber or Lyft didn’t think I was online is insane."
University of Dayton,"All this chatter about drivers making low pay is garbage!!!! As a part - time driver working 30 hrs or less a week in MN I average between $30-$50 hr. I’ve known drivers who have worked hard and paid of their Mortgage within a couple of years of driving. 
You sir, found yourself in a situation that sucks. However, you don’t know if driver A had a family emergency and had to cancel the ride or a different situation. This left the ride open for driver B, driver B may have suddenly found himself having car maintenance issues. And had to cancel. We do not receive destination info on the app when we accept rides. For me, if a $90 fare is 10 minutes away, I’m jumping at it. However as another commenter stated. I may get screwed on the return trip. So…….. tip nicely.  If I drive (? An hour and a half) to pick you up then another (?hour and a half) to your destination. That’s 3 hrs of my day on one drive and if there are no rides on the return trip, $90 is nothing. 
And yes, out of your $90 I’m possibly seeing $40."
University of Dayton,"I missed a niece's wedding because of a scenario like this one.  And had to pay an extra. $68 to re schedule plane tickets.

Lyft should be put out of business.  And Government should step in and close down a company like Lyft when they show the contempt toward consumers that Lyft exhibits."
University of Dayton,If the driver accepted the ride then cancelled then they are just assholes
University of Dayton,"I drive GSP, but Uber only, and live near Clemson. I have several semi-regulars from outlying areas where rides to the airport are nonexistent at the times they need to travel. Where are you coming from?"
University of Dayton,You can’t rate a driver who didn’t give you a ride. It’s also true they can’t rate you. It’s to protect people from revenge ratings which do happen sometimes for no reason.
University of Dayton,"There are too many customers, too many drivers and only a few options for public transport. 

This is bound to happen."
University of Dayton,Lyft and Uber do not pay their drivers enough to created any sort of continuity or reliability. Try a taxi service or pay a friend
University of Dayton,Lyft doesn’t pay any extra for scheduled rides in my market. The driver was getting probably around $20 or less for the trip. Wasn’t worth it
University of Dayton,"First off, do you know why they cancelled? No you don't, what if rhey had a flat tire to start their day? Or... theyvended up running their child to the ER, and you want to give them a bad rating?? For what?  What part of the ride that you didn't have deserves bad rating,  
Also, that $90 ride, the driver isn't even getting half of that on 90% of the time.  Next.     I've reserved rides like you pointed out, and when I log in to go get my reservation, Lyft assigns it to someone else, even though I had the reservation and was logged on on the platform with plenty of time.  

 That's like me trying to leave a Negative rating for you, for you canceling the ride when I'm sitting out front waiting!!

Your comment about Happy Customers... what about Happy Drivers.  What you DONT KNOW is what Lyft is doing to the Drivers and dropping the pay since unveiling UP FRONT PRICING!!! What you DONT KNOW, is we get screwed on pay driving you to the airport!!!!!

What needs to be done, is Lyft needs to realize how badly they are SCREWING BOTH OFVUS RIGHT NOW!! They're hurting BOTH if us right now!  And Yber is doing the same!

Reach out and ask, what is it like Driving for Lyft/Uber?  You wouldn't work your job, and work 40hrs and only get paid for 32! That's what every driver has been facing for Months now! The Medua releases you see is simply to please shareholders, Govt Officials and those who have no real clue in the truth these Drivers face. 
Can't class action them due to their Arbitrary clause.  Every single Passenger I explain this to, had no idea, NONE!"
Penn State,It's late notice but can you tell the court you don't have a car and it's not easy for you to get there?  You might get excused.
Penn State,"you can pre-book rides on uber. I'd recommend doing that, some drivers prefer the long routes and less busy town streets"
Penn State,I have gotten multiple Ubers from state to altoona no problem
Penn State,This is the best place to ask that question. Best answers given.
Penn State,i’ll drive you for free where do you live
Penn State,"trust me, there are student who take uber/lyft all the way to JFK.

I've seen it with my friends, heard of it

cost is about $600-800, but as long as driver accepts it then its good to roll"
Penn State,"Yes, but on the weekends the upcharge is crazy because everybody is ubering to parties."
Penn State,i recommend nomad rides! it's very affordable and the owner was very nice when my friends and i met him.
Penn State,"SC is dominated by Uber, I had uninstalled Lyft for a long time"
Penn State,During busy weekends like home football games or graduation it can be expensive and delayed. Other than that Uber is a pretty good bet.
Penn State,They seem pretty busy.  I live just off N. Atherton and I see them zipping by all the time.  Be advised that peak pricing does come into effect on busy days and move in day will definitely count.
Penn State,You can schedule an Uber and get a confirmed driver beforehand.
Penn State,You can schedule one of the real taxi services in state college.
Penn State,i had no issue getting a lyft at 4am a few years ago to the airport
Penn State,"Be there at 5, they open the checking in an hour before the flight, if you get there before you will just sit there and wait.
You can start looking for rides early, but you won't have to worry about being late.

Edit: I'm assuming SCE airport"
Penn State,I always wake up at the time I’m taking a Lyft and check if cars are around normally like a week in advance
Penn State,Just schedule and Uber or Lyft in advance
Penn State,"Honestly in my experience, I only arrive at the airport 15 minutes before the boarding starts. It is EXTREMELY small, so you will never take more than 5 minutes for check in + security. Ubers are your best bet and more than always they will be there, unless there is snow."
Penn State,I’ve had a couple of close calls with this but always got lucky. Sounds like cabs are no longer in state college??? If that’s true try to get a friend to take you. That’s your best bet
Penn State,Had done some Uber trips around that time recently. You should be fine considering that people are mostly back now. Shouldn’t wait more than 30 min.
Penn State,Hey were you able to get to the airport without issues? I'm running into the same problem (5:14am flight) and Nittany Express says that they don't have any drivers available at that time :/
Penn State,"I drove about 10 hours each of the past two weeks and made about $170 after taxes taken out. So usually a rate of $15-$20 per hour of driving. Then take out $60/week for gas (for me) and that drops profit down to around $100. You can drive more hours of course, which I plan on doing, but I've just had other things going on as well that keep me pretty busy. 

But you really have to drive late nights Thursday through Saturday to get constant work. The other days it's slower and sometimes you'll sit 15 minutes or longer for a ride, and you don't want to sit out of range of the hottest area because other drivers are driving around constantly and will get selected for all the rides.

Do I enjoy it? Well, it's okay. It was super stressful at first having strangers in my car and having to navigate through crowds of drunkards in the middle of the streets downtown. But I got used to it. I even started listening to podcasts while I'm driving so I can do something productive because I got tired of just music for hours, and luckily the passengers don't seem to mind and one even liked the podcast I was listening to. Ideally I would rather not drive, but if I have to in order to make money that I need, then I have to do it. "
Penn State,This was just asked last week. Do some searching. 
Penn State,Are you in NH riding off the Greater Boston Area wave if people? State College is in a rural area and is a small town pretty much. My guess is it would be a pretty tough market....
Penn State,"Hey! I drive weekends up at State College, and you definitely make a couple hundred a night for Thursday’s through the weekend nights. This time of year is the most lyft drivers will make because of the weather. Mostly college kids are the passengers so be ready for their drunk tendencies. Most Thursday nights I work at night till 3am and make a couple hundred and then same with Friday. Saturday you can do all day and make at least a couple hundred and then Sunday morning most likely a couple hundred as well. Hope this helps! "
Penn State,uber/lyft has always served me fine
Penn State,"Taxis, shuttles, and Ubers. Kinda crazy we don’t have a CATA stop there. https://www.universityparkairport.com/airport-guide/car-rentals-taxis-and-shuttles/

If you get desperate and need a ride DM me, I’m staff and work on campus."
Penn State,"I used to schedule an Uber or Lyft the night before and it always worked out for me. It was usually free, too, because the university gives a voucher to students using Lyft to get to the airport."
Penn State,Maybe try Handy Delivery if Nittany is not running that weekend
Penn State,You have to get an Uber/Lyft or a taxi.  There is no bus route and hasn't been for about ten years.  If you're at a hotel or something you might be able to use their courtesy shuttle.
Penn State,"Uber/taxi, or if you have a friend with a car you can ask them for a ride."
Penn State,"Take the Red Link to the Penn Stater Hotel, then ask the bellman/woman on duty to give you a ride to the airport.  You won't be asked if you're a hotel guest.  Shuttle ride is free, so tip your driver :)"
Penn State,"First of all, congrats for getting accepted and welcome to Penn State!

Now coming to your questions, I completely understand the cultural shocks you might face but you’ll be all good! There’ll be many students like you so there won’t be that big of a difference! You’ll feel like home :) (I came from Abu Dhabi too, and am international so I can relate to these questions)

1.	Nope, people don’t care where you’re from and won’t differentiate. In fact, people are excited to meet people from different countries. 
2.	Yes, there’s a pretty big Arab community. Not one of the biggest, but there’s a lot of Arab students. I’m not sure of an Arab students association but definitely there was homecoming parade pre-covid and you’ll definitely meet fellow Arab students. 
3.	You may find drunk students off-campus on weekends but it’s never an issue. Students get used to it, and you’ll make your own group of friends who share similar interests so don’t worry. 
4.	DoorDash and GrubHub are the most used food delivery services in Penn State and they’re pretty decent services. Uber and Lyft are the driving services but they’re really expensive so people tend to avoid most of the times. The CATA bus system is pretty widespread in State College area so you’ll mostly not face any traveling issues. There’s also a lot of groceries stores, so you’ll not face any issues in that aspect too
5.	Nope racism is not tolerated at all. Rules are pretty strict and if you face any such issue, you can always report it and strict actions are taken. You’ll hear racism issues barely but whenever anything like that happens, penn state is pretty strict in those matters and takes actions regarding that.

Hope that all clears your questions, and let me know if you have any further questions. You can also dm me if you have any specific questions as well :) Have a great summer"
Penn State,"I'm just gonna hit 3 and 5 here

3. Drunk students are definitely common Thursday-Saturday night, but most folks are chill. They either dont want the underage or are to drunk to cause trouble

5. Yes there are racists in and around campus. I wouldn't expect violence or anything, but there's definitely the subtle and more vocal stuff. This ties in with 3, but I would definitely avoid Pickles (a bar) on Tuesdays. Its ""country night"", and the only time I've witnessed overt racism."
Penn State,"as a person of color, gonna disagree with comments saying racism doesn’t happen because it does. it obviously isn’t known as much to people who aren’t of color because it’s not happening against them lol. the school is okay at taking care of things and i’ve experienced a few incidents where they haven’t made me fear for my life but have rattled me or made me uncomfortable. more often than not though people are very excepting and nice to you but you may run into some issues every once and a while. also the drunk people thing, you’ll definitely have people approach you soemtimes saying soemthing crazy to you especially if you’re a woman or with women but it isn’t often unless you are where all the parties/bars are which is downtown area and they usually leave you alone if you walk away"
Penn State,"In the State College area and Penn State you shouldn't have any issues. The outside surrounding areas is a little different as it tends to be more ""white conservative"". That being said I doubt you will have a reason to visit those areas anyway."
Penn State,"I think the other commenter hit most of the points, so I’ll just share a couple points.

First, I only know of one mosque because I used to drive past it on my commute. I’m sure if you are looking for one, you’d find more options. State College is a small oasis where you can find most of what you need.

Secondly I just wanted to talk about your last question because I disagree with the other comment. PSU is a very large school and it is predominantly white. Overt and covert acts of racism are not uncommon. Now, where I will agree is that I think the university usually responds whenever major events do happen. There are whole offices and student groups designed to work with PSU community members who experience racism. I’d check out the PRCC for a start on what resources are available.

Just as a disclaimer, I’m not an undergrad and never was here, so I don’t know what it’s like on campus or downtown after football games or on State Paddy’s day or anything like that."
Penn State,"سلام عليكم اخوي و الله يحييك في بنسلفانيا، اذا عندك اي سؤال عن المكان و الجامعة اتواصل مع النادي السعودي:


https://instagram.com/sasa_psu?utm_medium=copy_link"
Penn State,"For associations, there is a [Saudi student group](https://www.facebook.com/SASAatPSU/) on campus, although I'm not familiar with how active they are. There is a [Muslim Students Association](https://www.pennstatemsa.org/) that is pretty active, though. 

I believe the [Islamic Society of Central Pennsylvania](https://www.facebook.com/ISCPonline/) is open for Friday prayers and generally facilitates communication across the Muslim community on and off campus. [Pasquerilla Spiritual Center](https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/campus-community-diversity/religiousspiritual-community/student-organization-profiles-services) on campus also has Friday prayer, since ISCP is not easily accessible for students, so that is probably an easier option if you're on campus. 

Groceries are very available with lots of options, and delivery services are great. Drunk people are less amazing, but all you really need to do is avoid downtown around the bars late at night (and the accompanying drunk food places like Sheetz or Yallah Taco) where there are crowds, if you're concerned about that. People don't normally get hostile on randos in my experience.

Racism is part of American society and consequently part of Penn State, as much as we hate it. Many students are still actively anti-racist which is extremely appreciated, but don't be surprised to run into harassment every now and then (as a South Asian student, I've dealt with a few instances of that). Racist violence is not common at all, but still does/can happen. This account from [last year](https://www.instagram.com/black_at_pennstate/) outlines many of those stories, but the good people well outnumber the racist ones, thankfully. There are also many groups actively working to root out racism in the university that you'll probs come across (and I'd recommend joining!)."
Penn State,"Just graduated in December so here’s my two cents.

1. Nobody cares where you’re from. The town and student body is full of people from everywhere.

2. I believe there’s a relatively decent sized arab community. And I’m willing to bet there are many clubs that you can join with other Arabs.

3. Drunk students aren’t inherently common on campus. On the weekends I’ve seen drunken brawls between morons who can’t keep to themselves. But your chances of being attacked by a drunk group of people is slim to none.

4. Food services are exceptionally well here. There’s grocery stores you can get food at. And Uber/shipt and all of those services are relatively fast and very common in SC.

5. I haven’t heard of any racist “incidents” per se. I’m sure it’s around but most people are really chill and friendly. That’s what made my experience at Penn State so awesome. You kinda just mesh into the crowd of fellow Penn Staters.

Congrats on getting accepted."
Penn State,"يا هلا والله

No, no one gives a fuck where you’re from. Also, drunk students are everywhere and dude, you’ll find lots of Arabs from around the Middle East (saudi, Jordan, Dubai etc)

Welcome to Penn State! DM me so we can talk more انا من السعودية كمان"
Penn State,"1. No.
2. We probably have some associations or something I think.
3. Yeah, especially on weekends. Both on and off campus. Most will not ""face off with you"" though, but like, don't expect to be shielded from it like you would at home either.
4. yes, but not directly to dorm rooms, only buildings, and yes.
5. I would say no, but people like to get up in arms about a few rare incidents, so I'm sure you will find people trying to say its some rampant problem."
Penn State,Switch to renewable energy engineering before you end up in a dead end career
Penn State,"Here’s something for you - Saudi Arabia is notorious as a misogynistic society. If you house any anti-women feelings you’ll want to leave them behind.

If you treat women as 2nd class citizens you’ll find your time here very unpleasant."
Penn State,">Hi.

Greetings!

> It's my first time living far away from home. I'm from Saudi Arabia, and I was able to secure a spot at Penn State and study Petroleum Engineering.

Congratulations and welcome to the United States!

> Obviously, you can guess the big culture shock that I'm going to face lmao.

> I have to ask, do people here really care where you come from? obviously I'm not going to scream out loud where I'm from every chance I get, but surely I'm gonna have some questions directed towards me when I meet new people.

From what I've experienced as a former employee of PSU and as a local, I'd say that for the most part, on campus it won't be a big deal and even in State College it won't be a problem.  Other students are generally pretty accepting or at least tolerant.  Locals in State College also are used to other cultures.

One thing I'd strongly recommend is the Conversation Partners Program (CPP).  It's a program designed to link international students with native English speakers who may be fellow students, faculty or staff, or even locals.  I myself have had a couple of students and it was a pleasure to meet them.  You basically meet with a person and talk to them about whatever you want, ask about cultural differences, or go out for social occasions with them.  It's pretty much up to you.  I had one young man from China and another from Saudi Arabia and it was fun speaking with them and hopefully they enjoyed my company as well.  

https://global.psu.edu/communityengageprog

> Is there a noticeable Arab community in Penn State? I would love to join any association of Arab students. Are there any mosques in State College? I don't think I'm going to pray everyday in a Mosque but I would like to pray in a Mosque on Fridays.

I'm pretty sure there is an Arabic group, and possibly a Saudi group.  You'd need to check with student affairs which would have more information.  Found one hit that might help, there may be others.

I took a quick look and found ""Saudi Arabian Student Association"" https://orgcentral.psu.edu/organization/saudi-arabian-student-association

This is the Muslim Student's Association which apparently has a Friday Prayer in the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center on Fridays from 1:30 to 2:30 pm.  
https://pennstatemsa.wixsite.com/psu-msacontact

This seems to be a non-university mosque.  I don't know how legitimate it is.  It's at 454 Rolling Ridge Drive which is a bit of a journey from campus and I personally don't know the area.
https://www.facebook.com/ISCPonline/

>Are drunk students that roam around that common? I have no experiencing of facing some random drunk guy throwing insults at me so I wanna know which areas should I avoid during the weekends lol.

Well, I don't live in State College proper, but generally the drunk idiots usually aren't out until late at night, usually on the weekends.  They pretty much just stay to themselves and unless you're trying to provoke them, they shouldn't bother you, especially if you're with friends.  Honestly, I wouldn't worry much about this unless you yourself are getting drunk in unfamiliar surroundings without any friends with you.  Basically I guess just don't be stupid?

>Also, how are the online services like food delivery apps and uber? Do you think that there is a sufficient number of grocery stores at State College?

Delivery is ok, but if you're living on campus, be advised you'll need to meet them outside or at the Commons Desk at the dorms.  They will not deliver to your dorm room since you need a keycard for those.  Uber is kind of expensive.  There are a couple of taxi companies but they aren't much better.  There are many grocery stores but if you don't have a car it kind of sucks since you have to tote those things back home.

>Lastly, and I hope no one takes this the wrong way, is racism from ignorant students common here? Have there been any big occurrences of racism that you heard of?

Like any place there will be racism but the university in general seems to be pretty tolerant and even accepting in most cases.  You will run into idiot racists but they suck and they are in the minority which I'm sure annoys them.  I'd be more concerned with your academics than what a few and unfortunately vocal people say.

>Thanks.

You're quite welcome.  Let me know if you have further questions."
Penn State,"I know of nomad rides but I don't know if they do long distances like to philly or exclusively only areas in state college: [https://groupme.com/join\_group/69490888/OV0gQSSR](https://groupme.com/join_group/69490888/OV0gQSSR) doesn't hurt to ask. That's the groupme join link. The founder is pretty active so just shoot him a DM. ""DK (Nomad Founder)"" is his user"
Penn State,"What happened to the ride-share board that was in the HUB?  I was at PSU in the early 90's and I always used it for rides back home, and I just assumed it was moved online."
Penn State,"You can always take the Megabus from the Walmart Supercenter on N. Atherton to Philly as well. Always an option if you can't find a ride but obviously the time would be set and you would probably spend less time with family and more time sitting on a bus.

Edit: Greyhound as well, they have shorter rides and later departures if you have classes."
Penn State,"You’re not really saving any time by driving to Pittsburgh or Philly. Just take the connection. Also - he’ll make friends and come to terms that some of the fall breaks and other short holidays may be spent with people who live closer to campus and have welcoming homes. 

Depending on how independent your son is will probably determine how homesick he may get. Dallas is a long way from State College, but if he’s ready it can help shape him into a good man. Living 9 hours from home forced me to really grow up fast at that age."
Penn State,"I'm from the Dallas area. Most of the flights are kind of a pain. You can fly out of Pittsburgh or Philly, but the buses are so slow that most people just drive or get a ride there.

Flying out of State College is the easiest thing, but you're very limited on flights and will have to deal with a layover somewhere. Also, if you don't book your flights home at Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc., months in advance, prices are nothing short of insane. My flight home at Christmas was only manageable because I had a $450 flight credit and could fly on an off-day. If I'd gone two days earlier, it literally would have been more than $1000 to get home.

I've heard that some people fly out of Harrisburg, which is easier to get to from State College than Philly or Pittsburgh, but it still takes a lot of planning."
Penn State,"Fly directly into state college. You just gotta deal with the layovers. There’s no real way to get to pit or Philly from state college. The busses I’ve seen don’t *really* work. Or if they do, it’s a 6 hour ride."
Penn State,Curious why someone from Dallas would attend PSU? Full ride scholarship?
Penn State,"megabus can go to Pittsburgh.

Flying back to Texas will include connecting flights."
Penn State,"Amtrak runs daily buses from Harrisburg to State College, though he would need to get a ride from HIA to the station in downtown HBG. Just another option to consider in place of Pitt/PHI."
Penn State,"I'm from Austin and travel to Penn State!

Usually my parents drive me up for the fall, and drive me back after spring semester for the summer. 

In between if I decide I want to go home for break, I usually use the airport that is in State College to get home. The airport there is super small and does not take too long to get through.  Yes you usually have a layover but it's not too bad! In my experiences so far it has been super easy and not too stressful!"
Penn State,"we're fortunate in that there are direct flights from central Florida that started a couple of years ago.  Alternatively, you can fly into MDT and take a bus up (daughter does this some times) but MDT is still a relatively small airport.  

That's one of the problems with these land grant schools...they're often in the middle of nowhere."
Penn State,"Buses to Harrisburg are probably the cheapest/easiest if you don't want to fly out of State College; it's not a bad Uber trip from the bus station in Harrisburg to the airport. I'd say Megabus to Philly is the next best option, since that bus stop is near 30th Street Station and you can take SEPTA to the airport from there. Newark's not bad either for the same reason, but you'd have to take Fullington/Greyhound buses that have additional stops and layovers and are much slower.

I know some folks here have also recommended getting a ride from State College to Tyrone to get on Amtrak but I don't believe that's much cheaper than the buses. There's also the option of making friends that live in any of those metro areas and hitching a ride with them as close as they can get to their airport."
Penn State,"I took a flight from State College to Dallas recently and it was simple, if I can do it I bet your son could too. I had a layover in Newark but it wasn’t confusing at all and I made it with no issues. If he’s somewhat independent he will be fine"
Penn State,"My bf is from Dallas and attends penn state!! He will either fly into Pittsburgh and we w drive up together, or he will just fly into state college"
Penn State,"I'll add more in a minute, but...

Just a note for everyone...Fullington is cutting service end of this month.  Most affects Harrisburg which has an airport and couple affect Pittsburgh as well.

https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/community/state-college/article259155648.html

*As part of the reductions, all trips to and from State College and Harrisburg (schedules 703, 704, 705, 740, 715, 725 and 726) will be eliminated.*

*Also to be eliminated are schedules 710 and 730, which go between Pittsburgh, Dubois/State College and Harrisburg, and back. A new schedule very similar in times will be offered beginning April 1, according to the website. More information will be posted there.*

*Though there are some cuts, a new schedule that will take passengers to Dubois, State College, Harrisburg, King of Prussia and Philadelphia, and back, will begin April 1.*

EDIT:

Now that I got that out of the way, the big thing for taking a flight out of SCE vs. PIT or PHL is price.  You'll pay more for that connector, but honestly, if you rent a car and pay for parking at the airport it's not going to make a big difference and now your son will have to drive back three or four hours to get to State College.  Layovers suck, but at least you can take a nap or play on your computer or read instead of driving tired.

The best way of course is get a friend to take you to the airport but you'd better be a really good friend to have someone drive there and back twice.  For the love of god, you'd better fill up their tank both ways and buy lunch/dinner for them.  

You might get lucky and get someone who's already going there and just wants a buddy, but don't count on it."
Penn State,"The trailways bus to philly is pretty fast, 3 hours to get to king of prussia. But it is an extra $50 so might not be worth it for you"
Penn State,"My best friend, who I met at PSU freshman year, oh, 30 years ago, is from Alabama.  She came home with me to the Pittsburgh area for short breaks, like Easter, and when she flew out to see family, she caught a bus to Harrisburg to catch her flights.  Happy medium. 

The problem with the ""drive to Pittsburgh"" idea, is that drive can be a pain in the ass, or even impossible, like, say, around winter and spring breaks. I caught a bus a couple times. Yo.  Never again.  The best thing to do was catch a ride with another student with a car.  There's plenty of methods to hook up with each other there.  Either to Pittsburgh or Philly, even to Hburg. The State College airport is, hmmm, rinky dink.  But if you were going to fly from Harrisburg, it's a pretty equivalent option, time wise.  Flight availabilities are the only difference. There are little to no amenities at either airport. Rental car and a Starbucks. That's about it. 

Funny story, my best friend still lives in State College now.  I live near Harrisburg.  Her parents always flew in to see her via Philly and drove (a bit of an easier drive than from Pittsburgh), and they moved to Philly from Alabama.  Stg.  Penn State made Pennsylvanians of her whole family. 

We're actually joking via text messages right now, cuz I'm like, hey, is it spring break right now? Or this weekend?  Cuz I was gonna run up there for a visit this weekend or next, but spring break to us meant there was going to be a snowstorm to mess up everyone's travel plans.  It's just Murphy's law. 

Do with that info what you will."
Penn State,"Pittsburgh, state college, Harrisburg airports. I’m sure Pittsburgh will be most cost-effective!"
Penn State,"Also from DFW, I’ve flown my mom up to visit a few times and other than around the holidays we’ve always been able to get a flight (with a layover) in/out of state college.

Around the holidays you have to plan ahead and get your flight early. This past Christmas I flew back to Dallas, but I waited until after thanksgiving to buy my tickets. There were no flights out of state college left at that point. So I found a reasonably priced (for as late as I waited to schedule it anyway) flight out of Pittsburgh on American. There were better deals out of Arnold-Palmer with Spirit or another small airliner. 

I picked the one of PIT because I thought the greyhound would get me from state college to somewhere reasonably close to the airport. However that was a totally wrong assumption. The grey hound from sc to pitt was only $30 but it was like a 6 or 8 hour ride because of all the stops. If you drive straight through it’s only like 2.5 hours. Then the Uber from the station to the airport was $60. So on the return trip I just got a rental at PIT that I could turn in at the sc airport for the same price as the Uber + greyhound and saved myself the 6 hour bus ride. 

The other thing I learned on the bus ride was that this Arnold Palmer airport I had never heard of is a stop on the same bus route to Pitt (all together that would have been the cheapest option). So I wasted a lot of time and money not planning this trip right. There’s lots of options but you’ve got have a plan apparently. 

If you were trying to avoid rentals and driving and can’t get a connection into state college the grey hound to Pittsburg isn’t a terrible option IF you go with some friends and can split the Uber to the airport. The greyhound station in state college is in walking distance of campus so you don’t need an Uber, and if you get a flight out of Arnold Palmer the bus takes you directly to the airport. So that option avoids Uber all together."
Penn State,I really hate them doing this but my parents take a 16 hour round trip to get me in one day
Penn State,"I’m out of state from Colorado and I personally have never chosen to fly into State College just due to the limited and expensive nature of it. I am not sure if he has in-state friends or roommates who would be willing to pick him up from the airport, but I always get a ride from Philly or Pittsburgh with one of my roommates, works out pretty well."
Temple University,"They gave each code $20 x 4 trips, and said it was a $200,000 program, meaning only 2,500 vouchers could have been available. Good idea, but not great for a college with 40k people."
Temple University,I spent a while figuring it out this morning. You need to switch your payment method to something other than Apple Pay
Temple University,"Hey y'all,  someone from SAASA here! Should be renewing those codes and getting more by mid October! <3 lmk if you have any questions"
Temple University,"You could walk a block north to the Erie station of the broad street line, southbound it takes you right back to main campus. Obviously that's not free but it's an option."
Temple University,"If you're a freshman and you're worried about transportation, I would try finding a job near main campus anyway. I remember literally every semester all of these great jobs come up after the first week or two, and then I regret taking the first shitty offer I get. "
Temple University,"Temple offers free shuttle bus services between Main Campus, Health Science Campus, and the Ambler Campus. The schedule and locations can be found [here](https://campusoperations.temple.edu/parking-transportation/shuttle-services/between-main-campus-hsc-and-ambler). The last bus from the Health Science Campus is at 10:50 PM Mondays - Thursdays

Edit: The last bus on Fridays from the Health Science Campus is at 6:40 PM. Also this is not Flight. Flight and this shuttle service are completely different "
Temple University,"I’m assuming you live around main campus. If you can bike, you should do that. Safer than walking and way quicker and cheaper. Other than that—take the subway or Lyft/uber shared rides (the safest choice)which shouldn’t be more than 2-5 bucks each way 

Idk if temple offers anything "
Temple University,Library gang 
Temple University,"I’d say take the Broad Street Line from Erie to Cecil B Moore. You can get a [semester pass](https://bursar.temple.edu/sites/bursar.temple.edu/files/documents/Fall2018Uni%20Pass.pdf) for unlimited subway/bus/trolley use until December. There are shuttles too but I’ve found them to be not always on time, but the subway is frequent."
Temple University,Dont do it
Temple University,"I've used many rental programs the best is from rideshare rental .
You have to really drive 7 days a week 12plus hours to make it worth it"
Temple University,"They wont tell you this, but on top of the ride requirement per week and the $1000.00+ a month just on the rental cost alone, no gas included, renters only get paid half the rate a driver does that uses their own vehicle."
Temple University,"Renting is only an okay option if you already drive 60+ hours a week and already know what type of money you’ll make in your market. If you’re not grossing $1,500-$2,000+/week, then you won’t net much after expenses."
Temple University,dont do this shit unless you’re desperate. you’re gonna have to work about 70 hours a week to make it worth your while.
Temple University,"Some money, you can do it. It has to be 60+ hours online time minimum, every week (no missed week) 

Stressing on some money only."
Temple University,"Yup, working at least 1 and 1/2 jobs a week bro. You're talking 10-12 hr days with maybe 1 day off."
Temple University,I’m sorry but 10-12 hours in a rental car to make it worth it seems mind blowing 😱
Temple University,[deleted]
Temple University,"Renting through a rideshare company is a horrible deal. In my market, it would take 2-2.5 *days* of working to pay the weekly rental fees."
Temple University,"Idk what these ppl are talking about but I make 1K+ a week after expenses. Get lots of challenges and bonuses. Rental is 250 a week and I can make that in 10 hours, rest of the week is profit."
Temple University,"You can get it, pay the 400 a week, get the zero deductible, get the personal miles, and drive 20 trips while, for 4 days, to and from, working for an Amazon job paying 18 or more dollars....while working some other gig app that pays better and get in 20 rides before the end of the week.

They require you pay down the cost of the rental before you actually earn any income...which is stupid because you have no gas money, cleaning, or food money until you pay off the car.. hints you add in personal miles, however many you'll need, and use those to get paid since you are new and bounes aren't a thing until you do a certain number of trips.

Well, at least that is what it was for me ..no bonuses showed until I was over 100 trips and had a great score with customers..which is also stupid because they lie a lot to get you kicked from the platform as they be something of stupidity that need a Lyft or Uber to get to work yet screw drivers that are willing to give them the rides..having cameras matter and living in a one party consent to recording state matters.

End of week is how long you have to get those 20 rides..which start on Monday and ends on Monday of the following week.

Come September 11th, is a date they say rental changes are coming, as in cost not an end... I suppose. Figure they are either raising the price, 400 dollars a week is outrageous already, or giving out incentives for rental drivers. I would not bet on the second one... because that would make too much of a benefit to us drivers who make them money as they don't have to rely on customer's tips as we do because they take 80 to 90 percent of the money charged to customers.

I am having a ragging clue its a screwing coming real soon and 9/11 is the date they chose....America get screwed again in the gig economy...I literally can't afford to work lyft full time with the stupid cost before income is earned.. not sure why they would not just take 40 or half earnings each day while you widdle down the cost of the rental... also gave out more funds to renters.. the major issues you have to consider are if you are young, in shape, and willingness to work 5 or more painful jobs just to survive or can you be OF girl that earn 30k per month doing the laziest job in the world getting paid like a lot of art BS jobs that don't really contribute to society..such as Athletes, artists, designer clothing brand maker, idiot influencer on social media, politicians and the list goes on....LOL"
Temple University,[removed]
Temple University,"I didn’t bring it first semester and then had it for the last 3.5 years. Never paid for parking. Once you learn the parking patterns and where spots are it’s fairly easy. If it’s a newer car I’d probably leave it home, but I had an older car that I didn’t car if it got bumped or scratched. Was able to do Uber and Lyft to pay my rent too. Being able to drive to good grocery stores and run out to grab things easily instead of having them shipped and stolen off our porch off campus was great."
Temple University,"Matters on who you are. I am from Virginia and only go home during breaks - and since I live in the city 24/7 I walk, bike, SEPTA everywhere with relative ease. If you're someone going home to the suburbs often, or need to get to somewhere not accessible by public transit I would bring your car.

Personally, I think it fun to at least try city life without a car!"
Temple University,"Imo it’s not necessary. Public transportation is part of what makes Temple great. If you need to go to VA or NJ, amtrak is always an option depending on where you need to get to in those states. I’ve heard too many stories of people getting their cars stolen, scratched, dented, etc. I just don’t think it’s worth the risk when you have Septa close by."
Temple University,not needed as freshman. bring it to campus sophomore year
Temple University,If you live on campus or real close to campus you definitely don't need know car everything you need is literally in walking distance or a short bus ride.if you do get a car you definitely gotta worry about car break ins and parking
Temple University,"I’ve had my car on campus for the last two years and imo it’s been very helpful. I live off campus at UV so I use it to go grocery shopping, travel home, and also to take my friends places. It’s also super useful if you can’t get home by bus or train so you don’t have to wait for someone to pick you up."
Temple University,"I spent 13 semesters at temple, 12 of which I lived on or just off campus (the final one I commuted from fishtown only a mile away). I kind of went back and forth with having my car, sometimes it makes sense other times it doesn’t. I’ve always been able to easily get anywhere with septa, so even semesters I *did* have my car I didn’t use it too often. The only time it truly made sense to have it, would’ve been when I lived in an apartment on norris that had no w/d, so I’d have to drive home to the burbs every couple of weeks to do laundry…otherwise it’s kinda a pain because Philly driving can be stressful (and so can finding a spot if you don’t buy garage access). I’d also note that, if you want your car just in case but don’t think you’ll need to drive much (and can afford an extra $400 a semester) I’d say just get a liacouras/Montgomery pass, you won’t have to check on it as much as you would if you leave it on a street somewhere, and you’ll always be guaranteed a spot when you come back if you ever do have to drive somewhere. 

Tl;dr…if you’ll regularly need to get somewhere that’s not near septa, bring the car; if not it might not make sense. Just evaluate your situation and decide based on what seems best."
Temple University,"Dont bring it to campus my guy as alumni. You can literally travel the entire city by subway and train. Ive been living in philly for almost 5 years I have a car now the only time I use it is when I travel to virginia. But I left my car at home because there was no need of it cause I could use subway, trolley, and the line so its very easy to get everywhere"
Temple University,"Even though the pass is 400 a semester, it's totally worth it if it's a new car and you don't want dings, scratches or etc happening. It's useful for grocery shopping, going out, going back home and it served it's purpose for me anyway"
Temple University,Nah. You can get around Philly pretty easily through public transit or with a bike. Fresh grocer is right on campus so you don't have to go far for food either
Temple University,I park my car in the garage and use it to drive to work and to drive home (out of state) on some weekends and school breaks. I’m also a nursing student so I need it for clinicals.
Temple University,It’s only helpful if you pay the $400 semester pass for the parking garage otherwise it’s just stressful having the car on the street.
Temple University,100% great for getting grocery’s and going to see family. I also stay in Philly for the summer so having a car to go on quick beach trips is always useful
Temple University,Very useful. I enjoy taking my charger red-eye hellcat Challenger scat pack and doing donuts on broad every Saturday night
Temple University,"I use mine a lot but that’s because my job is in NJ on the weekends. Unless you’re in my situation or wanting to go home to visit often I don’t think a car is necessary, especially since I’ve had mine vandalized, it’s a risk but for me personally I think it’s worth it."
Temple University,"Had mine from Sophomore year to senior year. Was awesome minus all the parking tickets I got. Being able to drive to grocery store and around the city was really beneficial. Just be aware your car and tires will get dinged up, and don’t leave visible valuables in the car. Other than that I highly suggest it"
Temple University,"i think it’s really useful, you may not need it freshman year though. be prepared for it to get beat up- i’ve had my window smashed, side mirror taken off, and my back bumper has been hit on three separate occasions- taking out the tail light twice. this is all in the course of less than a year. i would chock most of that up to bad luck but also be prepared to walk up to your car with a new ding or scratch every so often. the garage is nice but expensive. there’s lots of free parking and if you end up living off campus certain streets have residential parking passes. they’re like 35 bucks a year for free 24/7 parking. also make sure to always leave your car empty- people will break into it for next to nothing."
Temple University,Sell ur car Get a motorcycle
Temple University,"Depends on what you’re doing frfr. If you plan on going to places far off campus that you can’t access by septa, I’d say bring it. If you’re just going to leave it sitting around, it might not be worth the investment"
Temple University,"Honestly only bring your car if you plan on driving back home often or if you like to explore places outside of the city on the weekend. I have my car here and I use it a couple times a month but that’s only when I’m being lazy or want to leave the city. Also parking on the streets is free depending on the street but sometimes it’s frustrating trying to find a spot close to wherever you are living. 

If you do decide to bring it remember to keep the inside clean at all times and never leave anything out that could catch someone’s attention to steal. Having your car here gives you one more thing to be anxious about. I would only bring it if you really think you’re gonna use it."
Temple University,i bring my car cuz i work but if you aren't working and just staying on campus you probably won't need it
Temple University,It's good for getting stolen
Temple University,"Everyone’s case is different but in my case, my house is close enough to campus where I can just leave the car home and not worry about parking or having it broken into, but also be able to use it if needed. I did have the car on campus for a moment in time until it got towed and broken into the same week (luckily not stolen). It depends where you want/need to go. If you’re staying within Philly or traveling between other major cities, you have public transit and Amtrak. If you’re going outside the cities or to heavily car centric areas, it helps significantly."
Temple University,"If you’re commenting to campus sure but if you’re on campus I don’t really see the point. Amtrak takes you pretty far and there’s also greyhound busses for spots that amtrak doesn’t hit. Regional rail, subway, busses and uber are also an option for areas near/ just outside of the city. I’d say skip it freshman year and if you find yourself really needing it bring it next year"
Temple University,It was nice having my car on campus for 2 years to drive to grocery stores/different areas of Philly/out of the city. I wouldn't recommend as a freshman.
Temple University,"No. Subway on one side and regional septa train on the other side. Anywhere you would want to go on campus is within a 10 minute walk usually, anywhere you'd want to go in the city is significantly faster via public transportation, and the subway fee is only like 2 bucks for any distance. Not worth the crazy expensive parking fees to have a car around. If your parent's home is within range of an Amtrak station, 30th St station is also accessible with just the subway, and the stop is literally right across the street from the train"
Temple University,"brother i did not get my license until after graduating, no car is extremely viable in the city, especially if you're fairly local to begin with."
Temple University,"After your first year, bring your wheels you’ll make your life much easier"
Temple University,"come if u think philly and temple is a good fit for you, lifestyle activities vibe yk.. like i feel pretty safe but its def like a you never know whay happens so just stay smart but u cant control anything situation"
Temple University,Can we get a tracker for every time this question (or something along these lines) is asked?
Temple University,ur gonna die multiple times
Temple University,yes ghouls and goblins roam the steets
Temple University,"I mean seeing how I lived on Cecil my first year off campus and my apartment got shot in to (I lived on the top floor-4 stories) I don’t think temple/north Philly is very safe. 

Then the next year, my car got broken into on 17th and on one occasion my roommate and I walked outside as someone drew a gun and began shooting at someone across the street.. would never recommend or go back to school at temple"
Temple University,"As long as you don’t walk around at like 2 am on the outskirts of campus and/or befriend student drug dealers, you should be fine. I never had a problem, but definitely know people who did and they almost exclusively fell into the previous categories. Things in Philly should also improve drastically after the mayoral and council elections that are upcoming in 2023, so safety should improve overall."
Temple University,Tbh I live very off campus and never feel like temple is very unsafe. Sometimes it’s bad but that’s usually far off campus. If you’re in the dorms you’re good. I’m not  in honors but I think u can only live in honor dorms ur first year.
Temple University,Ever heard of the search function?
Temple University,"if you are smart and travel in groups you will prolly b okay. just don’t be dumb, and be aware of your surroundings."
Temple University,"my opinion is not valid since I’m a commuter. I live off campus all the way in south Philly, and I’m on campus from 8am to 5pm, there is a few alerts but it’s honestly not that bad. You’ll be fine, just don’t wander around too much unless you really need too (like to go shop)"
Temple University,"I had a few people get shot and killed on my block this semester, so I wouldn’t say I personally feel safe. Although there are plenty of places that are safe to live around campus and especially *ON* campus. Not trying to scare you, but it seems the people in this comment section have had a very different experience than me so I wanted to add my two cents.

Edit: poorly worded. A few people were shot and two people were killed in 3 or 4 separate incidents."
Temple University,Yes.
Temple University,"Congratulations on your acceptance into Temple and the Honors program! Def try for the Honors LLC for living on campus all 4 years - many students will choose this option. As for safety, Temple does take a proactive stance on keeping students safe. And yes, you should be aware that studying and living in a major city like Philly has its upsides, and downsides - crime being one of them. I would visit the campus when you can to experience it for yourself, and also take a look at how Temple keeps our students safe - https://www.temple.edu/life-at-temple/safety"
Temple University,Anyplace is unsafe if you’re not smart and put yourself in a bad position. My four years there were some of the best of my life.
Temple University,"Live at the Kardon. It’s cheap, spacious, and on the opposite side of campus where most of the crime happens. I have never felt unsafe on this side of the campus. When I cross over I do not feel safe whatsoever and I’m amazed students live there."
Temple University,"It’s not great, but doable."
Temple University,Safe
Temple University,"uhhh depends, there’s been house break ins recently and my car got broken into. you just have to be smart like everyone else says. this isn’t like a suburban area where you can roam around care free. i say during the day you’re safe but at night is when i’d be careful"
Temple University,"If you're on campus you'll be fine. Occasionally there's a freak incident that effects those loving in the dorms but for the most part you'll be fine. Off campus is a different story, especially the further away you are. 1300 is great, try to get a room facing the courtyard in case of stray bullets."
Temple University,"Yes it’s dangerous, i live on campus only because I don’t want to be killed walking around at night and I don’t want my apartment to be broken into."
Temple University,"Ur good, don’t rent too far off campus and u should be fine."
Temple University,yes
Temple University,"I’ve lived in the “worst” areas like susquehanna/dauphin all 4 years and nothing happened to me or my friends, besides maybe a car window getting broken into when a friend left her (empty) wallet inside. Standard city things, if you have any exposure to poverty or urban life you’ll be fine but if not I guess it can be scary"
Temple University,"As someone that had the same concerns when I was deciding on colleges, I ended up being fine.  Even after going out almost every weekend.  Just handle your liquor well and beware of your surroundngs.  Remember that a $20 uber can be a lot but can save your life.  Temple offers “flight” which is a free bus that takes you anywhere on/off campus.  I used it a lot to be dropped off at frats sometimes, even to avoid cold walks!"
Temple University,Yes
Temple University,You’ll be fine. I’ve never felt unsafe because I don’t put myself into unsafe situations. Take that information as you will
Temple University,We’re all just cats. We got nine lives and luckily I’ve only used up 3 at Temple so far
Temple University,"Compared to what you're likely used to, no it's not safe. That's not to say you'll constantly be in danger either.

I lived off campus for 3 years and had little to no trouble (my catalytic converter and bike got stolen, but I was basically asking for it each time 🤪). Being safe mostly comes down to basic street smarts & situational awareness. 

This is the perspective of a 6'2 male though, so I can't speak for everyone."
Temple University,"As a alumni commuter I can say the Temple campus is safe, along with the dorms that are set up within the campus. However, the best way to look at it, the further you go North from campus, you'll be in an area you shouldn't be if you're alone (imo even the Hospital campus). However, the further you go South, the closer to the city so you won't be in a shady area, but you'll still encounter weirdos. I would visit the area first and try to do a Campus tour if you haven't done so yet because each persons experience will vary based on what they're looking for."
Temple University,"I feel like if you’re asking these kind of questions already, you know what’s up lol. Temple safety is ok. If you get offered a decent deal, and none of the better schools take you: I would go. If safety is a priority for you I would recommend staying at one of the apartment complexes directly on Temple’s campus. The surrounding area is sketch and the locals know who’s a student and who’s not  - so avoid late nights."
Temple University,"im a freshman in the honors dorms this year. i thought i’d stay in the honors dorm for most of college, but realistically most people move into apartments after freshman year. so you’ll probably end up doing the same if you want to stick with your friends. if you’re worried about safety the view or vantage is a good in-between option for if you want an apartment that is technically on campus but not considered a dorm as you enter later years."
Temple University,"I feel relatively safe, but I definitely think as long as you stay close to campus if you’re planning to live off-campus or in the honors dorm on-campus you should be fine. The advice I got my first year was from other girls at my work and that was to get Citizens, because it gives you extra piece of mind, on top of the escort services Temple already provides if you don’t feel safe or are out late at night. The advice of just knowing where you are is important and don’t take any classes super late unless they’re online and necessary. The end of the day, it’s something to think about and mull over for yourself personally."
Temple University,You make less money because it’s their car. Shit is really not worth it… if I’m not mistaken you don’t make money until you pay the rental first high is deducted
Temple University,"Im a flexdrive renter and yes they do lower your rate. You can make money. My weekly rental is $210, that includes insurance. Yes my rate is lower but i get to use a car for personal trips, i can return it whenever, im not destroying my own property. If I drive seven days a week, i only have to earn $30/day to make rent"
Temple University,Yes you make less make cus the cars gonna run you 1000$ a month at cheapest plan but also the rate card is lower so you’ll also get paid less per ride compared to other Lyft drivers
Temple University,"Im trying this out and will report back, need some sort of second job before I lock in a second restaurant job. 

But just some simple math here

Either way, there are way better ways to make money in this world. This is only something that should be done in emergencies (which I am in at the moment), and Lyft knows that hence the horrid pay.  Then, 600x.80 = $480 to account for taxes (Need to set aside 20% to be smart.  That means if I work about 30 hours/week Ill net $150/week. Thats $600/month I didn't have in my pocket before. Then divide 600 by total hours per month and you get 5. So to rent a vehicle from Lyft, you make about $5/hour after taxes and fees. If you want to do all those same calculations with a car you're making payments on its probably a little bit better but harder to factor in cost of maintenance and more upfront costs. And if you own the car and want to run it into the ground, I guess this is the best scenario but just know you pay for everything either now or later, that's the way the world works.

Either way there are way better ways to make money in this world. This is only something that should be done in emergencies (which I am in at the moment), and Lyft knows that hence the horrid pay."
Temple University,"Don't believe these people on here. I have been renting with lyft for 7 months. I make between $1700 and $2100 a week. My rental costs $251 a week. It is deducted from my account on Mondays starting at 5am. So the first $251 I make goes to lyft. But I leave the app online and also do Empower, or uber. So I'm still able to cash out something on Mondays. I have a Honda Insight 2021. Get 60 MPG costs $20 to fill up every 2 days. Drive about 400 miles a day. Put over 35000 miles on this car in 7 months. Do you really want to do that to your personal car????? I pay about $1000 a month. It covers rental, insurance, all oil changes, pm, all repairs are done at my house or the Hub. Free of charge with a free loaner. I add $30 per week and have zero deductible for accidents. I can run this car I to the ground. And when it bottoms out. I just swap it out for another one."
Temple University,"It’s a very , very bad idea. Find another way to get a car."
Temple University,It depends on your market.
Temple University,It used to be 45 against 60 cents per mile difference
Temple University,"My market is Washington DC, Virginia and Maryland"
Temple University,Don’t do it it’s 1600 a month just in rental
Temple University,It feels like it’s a combination of traffic and a lot of drivers having legitimately no idea how to navigate their way to the pickup point. I’ve ran into this a lot.
Temple University,It's a pain in the ass. And the gps is pretty rough so it often shows them on the wrong road
Temple University,Cabs are flat rate out of there and way faster usually. Cost is comparable.
Temple University,"I call Uber/lift once I get to baggage area and often find the driver spending like 5-10 min just stationary in a lot not far away after accepting. Once they start moving, seems to take another 5-10 min going that long way round (which is normal path I get it) but the last stretch always crawls weird slow, I too am curious if it’s just a gps issue or if there’s checkpoints? Overall 10-20 min waiting for a car is reasonable but I too wonder if there’s reasons they show stationary on app so long so often. "
Temple University,"Ive had several experiences where they message me asking where i am, and they are parked like a full mile away"
Temple University,I feel like they've always passed some pivotal turn right after accepting my ride
Temple University,They moved the driver waiting area and now you have to circle around the entire airport to get to the pickup spot
Temple University,"Frequent business traveler here. If I just missed an airport train, I walk over to the taxi stand and just jump in a cab & go."
Temple University,"this is why i always take a yellow cab from the airport. there's never a wait, and the price is similar, sometimes better"
Temple University,How can you know ahead how much the taxi will cost? I worry about getting in and a driver trying to negotiate as I’m in the cab.
Temple University,"I have to pick up my wife from the airport frequently and no one knows how or where to drive down there. That’s gotta be the leading cause. I’m there more frequently than the average person so of course I’m more familiar with nav’ing PHL than randos picking someone up for the first time, but the rideshare drivers are just as bad as the rest of them."
Temple University,"I've used lyft here twice. I went to the dedicated lyft pick up for the first one but they ended up asking me to fucking walk back to departures area. the second one was the other way around despite pinning the departures area. the second time I used it, I saw the driver circle the airport twice. I don't think they know where they're supposed to be or how to get there."
Temple University,"This used to happen to me all the time so I just started taking cabs. I don’t know if this is true, but I read somewhere that some Uber drivers stall hoping you’ll cancel if you’re only going a short distance."
Temple University,"What LAX did for Uber/Lyft pick up is so much better than a lot of airports, wish more would do the same."
Temple University,I miss the taxi stand actually having taxis.
Temple University,"Are you at the correct pickup point?  It switched a year or two back. .If the drivers are saying they don't see you, its probably because you walked out under the overpass area, where peoples family pick them up.  Uber/Lyft is behing there, on a different road."
Temple University,"Did you actually get charged for it on your Wells Fargo statement or is that just a 20$ line item in your Bilt Rewards transactions. I see the line item on the Bilt app, but it's not a charge I have to pay on my actual credit card statement from Wells Fargo."
Temple University,I also have the $20 Lyft Pass transaction 1 day after the my Lyft ride where I used the promotional pass. Really hope it doesn't show up on my statement.
Temple University,"Yeah it’s definitely a give and take. I’m not a driver, I typically use Lyft because it is cheaper."
Temple University,I'm in the philly market area as well but i find lyft a lil better. They are averaging bout 1.30 to 1.40 per mile.As far as uber they aren't as busy. By the way down in delaware. Maybe thats the difference.
Temple University,"Yeah. I’m in the Philly market. The only reason I do Lyft occasionally is because their destination mode actually works. Uber’s is terrible. If I don’t have to be somewhere, I always use Uber."
Temple University,">Can one earn enough driving solely for Lyft in, say, 30 hours to cover the rental+expenses should rental rewards not be achieved? 

Maybe, but do you want to drive 30 hours just to pay for the rental?

Rental is only useful if you drive enough to cover the cost, which is unlikely with the hours and days you have available.



"
Temple University,"I work in Philly with Uber and Lyft. I really don't think renting a car is a good idea, yeah at the end of the day you are using and print milage on your car but really what are cars for then? I can make 1200 a week easily if I work about 40 hours. If you want to work part time make sure you don't work set hours work when it is busy you will make more that way. I know sometimes you can't do that but it's a waste of time working dead hours. In my opinion dead days are Tuesday and Wednesday. But then again sometimes it picks up on those days so I go drive, I try to take off on those days. Work hard and smart you will make good money. You can make lots of money on the weekends. I start my Fridays at 2pm to 3am or if not busy 12am ... If looks really busy 4am. Saturday 4pm to 4am goal if dead go home at 12am. You really have to make your schedule after you know the market. I have been driving since August at first part time and now full time. I will be going part time again soon. My good days are Fridays to Sunday my goal is to pull in about 600-800 in these three days. The rest of the days I do it just cuz I am trying to hit the bonus."
Temple University,Here is an example of the days...https://i.imgur.com/KHxxeJj.jpg
UNLV,"To my knowledge, the closest thing UNLV offers is the U-pass which is a discounted RTC pass."
UNLV,they did free bus passes awhile ago. I had gotten one idk if they are doing for next semester tho
UNLV,"Even I hate Lyft too much, ( and even that price surge wont affect the driver ), this is probably the algorithm. Lyft fired lots of people bec of their greed, no one is sitting in front of a computer and surging prices through any event, i am sure. Too many ride requests"
UNLV,"I drive in Las Vegas. All you need to do is apply on the app. No way to apply in person. When you do apply on the app, use my referral code so you and I get extra bonus when you complete a certain amount if rides. 

Hey! Drive with Lyft in Las Vegas, and you get a bonus up to $760 if you give 210 rides in your first 30 days. Terms apply. https://www.lyft.com/drivers/LEE58038

I also recommend applying for Uber as well. 

I just invited you to earn with Uber. Earn at least $2,510 for your first 230 passenger trips in 30 days. https://drivers.uber.com/i/2b3d3yevdrfg

And if you use my referral code, I’ll be happy to teach you the tricks of the trade. DM me when you apply so I’ll know it’s you."
UNLV,We have WAY too many drivers out here. You not going to make money on Lyft out here.
UNLV,Use the school’s food pantry. They may be able to let you know about any other resources available as well.
UNLV,"It's been a while since I attended UNLV or lived in Las Vegas so this is more general advice but should still be helpful. 

Call 211. The operator will interview you about your situation, demographics, etc. and then give you a detailed list of programs and charities that can help you with your specific situation. Please note that they are a referral service so you will have to make additional calls and file additional forms to actually get help, but 211 will save you a ton of time in figuring out what help is available and there's a lot of programs out there that you may have never found on your own. 

While your current need is paying your rent, if you can cut all your other expenses then that leaves more money left over to pay your rent. So be sure to ask 211 about assistance with utilities, phone, internet, food, discounted bus passes, etc. and not just rental assistance. Anything you currently have to spend money on, ask if there's a program to help pay for it. For example, you can most likely get free phone service and heavily discounted internet service and you might not even have to switch providers. 

Not paying for groceries can be a HUGE money saver to leave you more money towards paying rent. Apply for food stamps (caveat: you may be disqualified as a student, but try anyway, the rules keep changing) and also start going to every food bank you can.  

Go to the food banks first and get as much free food as possible before going to the grocery store, then use your limited food stamps and/or grocery budget to only buy the missing ingredients necessary to turn the free food into meals. 

If you need other things like toilet paper, pet food, etc. then ask about that when you check in at the food bank because a lot of food banks have limited supplies of that available upon request but don't put it out on the main floor. If you have any dietary restrictions or don't have access to a full kitchen then be sure to tell them when you check in because they often have special foods set aside for people who need them.

If getting to the food banks is a problem because of distance or scheduling, contact them and ask them if they offer home delivery. Lyft has partnered with a bunch of food banks to provide free home delivery for people who are unable to go in person during the hours the food bank is open. You don't get as much choice in what you get since someone else is picking out the food for you but it's better than nothing. 

Before buying anything, ask for it on your local Freecycle and Buy Nothing groups. They're usually Facebook Groups but some places still do email lists. You can even ask for food there. A lot of people have stuff in their pantry that they realize they're not going to eat because they've lost their taste for it or started a new diet or whatever and they'll be happy to box it up and give it to you. Even if you have dietary restrictions or need something super specific, you never know -- I recently gave away a bunch of expensive fancy frozen vegan meals to a vegan because my husband had stocked up on the wrong flavor. 

Google ""Las Vegas"" plus ""mutual aid"" and/or ""free store"" to find informal resources that 211 might not have in their database. Lots of anarchocommunists and kindred spirits run regular weekly or monthly pop-ups in parks where they give away personal hygiene items, winter clothing, etc. to people who are homeless or otherwise living in poverty. ""Food Not Bombs"" is another good org, if they have a local chapter. 

Sikh gurdwaras usually offer a free meal at least once a week (sometimes daily) called langar and if you go to it then while you are there you can ask them if they are able to help you with anything else -- it's one of their religious commandments to help anyone who asks them for help and most Sikhs are delighted to be given an opportunity to fulfill that commandment to the point where they act like you did them a favor by asking. In my experience, the help they offer tends to be very personalized and more like one-on-one mutual aid than a formal charity program you apply for. It's a very tight-knit community so if you need a job then they can probably find you a job at a Sikh-owned company, if you need a working car then they can probably find you a Sikh mechanic who will fix your car for free/cheap, if you need a place to live then they can probably find you a Sikh landlord who will let you make reasonable weekly payments instead of needing to pay first/last/deposit up front, etc. I used to work for a Sikh and he was always hooking people up with stuff, including randos he'd literally just met (I was his bookkeeper so I got the backstories behind all his odd charges). 

If there is anyone who usually gives you a Christmas present, e.g., your parents, grandparents, etc. then be honest with them about your financial situation and ask them if they could please give you cash for rent instead of a gift this year. If they might not trust you with cash for whatever reason, you could ask them to write a check directly to your landlord / property manager or give them your rent payment portal login.

If someone ends up giving you a non-cash present anyway, scan the barcode and look it up on Google Shopping to figure out where it's sold, and if it's sold at Walmart, Target, etc. then you should be able to return it for store credit even if you don't have the receipt and then spend that credit on necessities like groceries, toilet paper, etc.

It's been a long time since I attended UNLV so I don't know what their current resources are but it's definitely worth making an appointment with the financial aid office to tell them you are in a financial crisis and see if there are any emergency funds or additional loans that you qualify for. Many schools have one-time emergency grants for students, or are willing to advance a portion of the next term's financial aid, but don't always advertise it so you have to ask to find out if it's even available. And while private student loans like Sallie Mae are generally not a good idea, taking one is less bad than becoming homeless.

If you've exhausted all of the above and are still going to be short on rent, talk to your landlord or property manager about it as soon as possible and work out a realistic payment plan. For example, if you won't be able to pay full rent on January 1st but will be able to pay as soon as your financial aid disburses later in the month, offer to pay them as much as you can on the 1st and then pay the rest by the end of the month.

A budgeting strategy that my husband and I have found helpful is to prepay our rent for the entire term as soon as he receives his law school financial aid disbursement so that we won't need to pay rent again before the next disbursement, then we use my income to pay for our other expenses. So we use August's disbursement to pay 5 months rent, January's disbursement to pay 4 months rent, and May's disbursement (he takes summer classes) to pay 3 months rent. Then we know our housing is secure even if I lose my job or we have some other financial emergency, and we don't have a large sum of money sitting around in our bank account tempting us to fritter it away on stupid shit. You might want to try that if you tend to run out of money at the end of the term.

Hope that helps! Good luck!"
UNLV,Donate plasma or apply for grants orrrrr even scholarships because they help sm! They should have some listed on the unlv website.
UNLV,"Here are things that help me. I live at home but pay all my bills myself besides rent, so I do have a bit more spending money.

\-Use the food pantry

\-Get snap (covers all of my groceries, free internet)

\-Get Medicaid! (so many random benefits, free costco or sams club membership which can save you on gas and SO MUCH on groceries) 

\-Really budget your eating out. It's fine to treat yourself but this is where I notice the most money wasted. If you do, make sure you take advantage of any deals through apps, receipts, reviews etc  

\-Use sign-up bonuses for new bank accounts. I just did wells fargo for $350. Do other accounts once you finish one. it's SO easy and free

\-Donate plasma using new-donor bonuses. CSL and Biolife are the major ones

\-This isn't a lot of money but see if you can make any claims for pocket change through Class Action Lawsuits

\-Sell extra things you have on depop or offerup etc, this is slow and unreliable but can help if you want to save up for something you want"
UNLV,"my recommendation would be to work part time so you qualify for all of the government benefits: snap, medicaid. 
and then i’d try to live on campus where 1) you don’t have to show proof of 3x rent, 2) there’s scholarships and you can also use loan money. 

that way, (i obviously don’t know your life circumstances), any money you earn from work will only be for gas & rent. (again idk about car payments, phone bills, or anything else you have to pay).



if that is a shitty suggestion, maybe just take out loans and use your loan money to survive. 


also if you end up qualifying for medicaid and what not, look into other programs medicaid recipients can access. for example, i just moved to IL for med school & if you are on medicaid you qualify for free internet. so i don’t pay for any internet at home. also if you qualify for snap, they’ll pay for a part of your heating bill every winter and you also get a hefty discount on tolls."
UNLV,"**There is an emergency relief fund for UNLV students:**

https://www.unlv.edu/campuslife/sos-fund"
UNLV,"In addition to the food pantry. I always recommend this 

https://www.weservelv.com/

It’s great part time work. If you don’t have a PILB card, you’ll want to apply as an usher. You’re only obligated to work a minimum of 4 days per month I believe. Two Saturdays and two Sundays. And you can ask for more hours if you need and if they’re available. Works really well with being a student."
UNLV,"Are you applying to FAFSA? If not, immediately apply and walk-in/call the financial aid for help on explaining how it works. Ideally you want to get “pell grant”. And please don’t be the guy who qualifies for pell grant but didn’t apply. Same as other grants. GO in and talk to financial aid people!!! 
Besides your job, I would try to work in a computer lab on campus. WHY? Because you can study while you’re working in those labs. ITS GREAT!! Since you will be putting in time studying, why not just work as a student in those computer labs.(unless your current job pays you a lot).

And lastly, give yourself a pat on the back for doing a great job this semester 👍 👏 👏. You now know you are capable of it!! You have no idea how big of an accomplishment that is for students who works a lot.(I also a in a situation like yours in 2018 and I almost quit school, I kept thriving one semester at a time, I now have a good fulltime position).

TLDR talk to financial aid people, they’re good at helping you with best solution. go apply to FAFSA, get pell grant, apply for grants, see if working at computer labs is better than your current job. If yes, then do it!"
UNLV,UNLV's Support Our Students (S.O.S) Emergency Relief Fund is exactly for your situation. Use it! And that goes to all the students who read this post. Here's the link to it: https://www.unlv.edu/campuslife/sos-fund
UNLV,What’s your major maybe consider public service like how teachers can work and get loans for given then take out those said loans or maybe join the national guard depending on your psych issues. They waive tuition for UNLV and other Nevada schools
UNLV,"Get a job on campus to fill your time between classes if you can. Most have down time so you're getting paid to study, which you have to do anyway right, may as well get paid for it. Helps build your resume too."
UNLV,Take out student loans. They exist exactly for this type of thing.
UNLV,"Honestly you should reach out to your academic advisor and the school. I dealt with homelessness my first two years of school and my academic advisor helped me find grants, scholarships and write out a plan on how to get through school. I know there’s a lot of recourses that the school can help with, like getting internet access for cheap"
UNLV,Good luck don’t give up.. u got this
UNLV,"Trade shows often pay well for day labor manning booths, etc.  CES here in January and should be big again (like more post-pandemic big, so more opportunities).  


It's hard to focus on school when you're hungry, worried about rent, etc., so def hit up the suggestions above to meet your Maslow's basic hierarchy.  


If you can stay in school, do.  So hard to pick up momentum if you take a term off.  Plus, you have more community at school of ""upwardly aspiring"" people (I don't mean that in a derogatory way, but if, say, you go work a job with people who are content to just ""be"" at that job, it can feel really isolating and even more depressing). 


Talk to advisors and professors re any jobs they may hear about - talk to everyone about this and let them know you're ready to go to work to support your goals. 


Most of all, keep that long term goal in mind.  Hard to do when you're struggling minute by minute, very hard to do.  


Also give yourself some credit for all you've already accomplished, against the odds.  That ain't nothin'!!!  Just think of all you can accomplish when more of your needs are met.  In the whole scheme of things, could be you're closer to your goals than it feels like when you look at the empty fridge, the sky-high electric bill, etc.  


You've survived that kind of hardship, so you clearly have resilience, and that's a better indicator of forthcoming success than grades or showing up to class chauffeured in a Maybach.  Seriously.  You've made it this far, you're rightfully worn thin, but you're still moving forward.  


Hit the pantry, get some good food, and have a few nights of solid rest on a full belly, and I promise it will be easier to find the opportunities."
UNLV,Do you have a roommate to pay half the rent?
UNLV,"I have been in a similar situation and what I did was reach out to financial aid and was explicit about my situation, telling them what happened in detail as well as describing my plan to graduate and my determination to make it work, but that financial help was really needed. They helped me get Tuition+ and as along as I am enrolled full-time, they will pay for my tuition and some books as well. Are you eligible for financial aid?"
UNLV,The only thing I can guarantee is that it’s better than having no job.
UNLV,"Vegas Uber driver here. It’s kept me afloat during times I was between steady jobs. If you can master not only WHERE but WHEN to drive, it can be decent. Even more so if you’re like me and your car is fully paid off"
UNLV,"If you know how to get around, especially with all the F1 closures — you can make money. I made around $300/day and had to deduct gas from that. 

But I got a brand new SUV and don’t wanna trash it. So I went back to driving a cab full time — which is better money and less stress."
UNLV,I do gig work. I’ve never done rideshare so can’t answer about Lyft but  you can make decent money doing Ubereats during lunch and dinner and you can make good money doing spark if you multi app both of them you can make 30 an hour
UNLV,As a driver for both platforms. Lyft pay is crap.  You’ll make more money with Uber.
UNLV,"Uber > Lyft

Make sure you get a sign up referral/bonus when signing up"
UNLV,Uber is a well established name in the industry. People flock to it just because others do. Lyft does have it’s fair share in the industry but when “most” people want a ride.. the instinctively choose Uber just due to conditioning. Go with Uber. You will make more.
UNLV,I’ve never driven but I saw someone in /r/uberdrivers describe Uber in Las Vegas as a “cheat code.”
UNLV,Uber is good
UNLV,"Yes, I know a couple lyft/uber drivers, most use both platforms. One driver makes just $760- $1,000, working just 3 days a week and not on the strip. Another makes over $2,000 in 5 days just doing airport rides, but she'sprobably driving for 10 hours. Of course there's insurance expense, fuel, cost of renting a car $239 a week through lyft or uber relationship with Hertz. Both Lyft & Uber want drivers to have newer vehicles so many drivers have to rent."
UNLV,Yes it’s totally worth it. Log on and drive. - Lyft
UNLV,It’s great money if u treat it like a business
UNLV,"That's ten hours of driving for how much money, exactly?

You can't spend your whole day on a single charity case and make a living."
UNLV,"Fuck no. He can cry all he wants. That sounds like a Lyft to the bus station or airport. 

But, some dumbass will take it. Actually since this post is an hour old, assuming this happened right before you posted this, some dumbass is probably doing it right now. Is approximately 4 more hours we will see a post titled “what the fuck Lyft is bullshit” posting a screenshot of only getting paid 198$ to make the trip, and in the comments something like “Lyft is a bunch of thieves. I drove this raving lunatic from LV to LA, 198$ with no tip! I’m now stuck in California because I can’t afford gas to get home because Instant pay out doesn’t work and it’s going to cost me another 75$ in gas to get home!” Someone help me!"
UNLV,Unless there were five $100 bills in his hand ready to give to me (in addition to what Lyft paid) heeeeeeellllll no I would not take that ride.
UNLV,That’s ridiculous. I would have referred them to the Greyhound station. There’s no way you could realistically expect someone ordering a Lyft back to Vegas from LA so you’d be stuck! I wonder too how much that ride was for passenger and how much you would have been paid
UNLV,Negotiate off app for cash.
UNLV,"Offer to do it under the table, send the money thru PayPal or Venmo"
UNLV,Possibly as an effort to help someone out. Certainly not for the money - you would LOSE money on that ride.
UNLV,If you want need to get to Los angels do it but if not not worth it ! Unless you are Lux driver getting paid Lux per mile
UNLV,No. Take a greyhound or payout of $600
UNLV,"Iv taken this ride. A black came in from SD, guy had a business meeting in Vegas no flights would make his time. If he left right then he'd make it.

I took him off uber for 2 reasons 1) I have tcp and ins. 2) I'd make like 1000 to 1200 for 4.5 hours one way. Not enough.

He and I agreed on full black rate which I think back then was 1600. It's a little less now, did round trip in 1 day took 14 hours total including traffic. $150ish in gas (might been less but I don't remember it's been too long)"
UNLV,How much you usually make in a day? Ask for that in cash on top of the ride maybe. Though he may report you
UNLV,"The drive won't go beyond state line. I got a request to the edge of Nevada last year and when I arrived to p/u passenger, the group of 4 people said their car broke down and they needed to get to Riverside before work tomorrow. I took the ride to state line (XL ride, ~$90) and then charged them $400 cash to Riverside. I was already pretty tired from driving all day and that was a bitch getting back. I was soooooo tired. Thankfully an old friend called me on Facebook and kept me awake and from passing out behind the wheel. I probably shouldn't've taken it, but they seemed desperate so I did them a solid."
UNLV,Did he call it or did the hospital? If it was the hospital there’s no way in hell anyone would do it . It doesn’t pay shit and the chance of a tip are 0% . But if the guy called it I would negotiate and do it for whatever Lyft quoted them
UNLV,Never accept rides from hospitals
UNLV,The hospital is paying for it.
UNLV,I would’ve shown him how to use the FlixBus app. Then taken him to the stop he needed to goto to catch it.
UNLV,I dont want to ride 5 mins with someone that just had their stomach pumped.
UNLV,"Easy no. But did you get any story, what is this the Hangover!?"
UNLV,I haven’t heard much from Gary Bussey lately. Nice to hear he is ok.
UNLV,"If its a third party paying for it, like the hospital, just don't say you dropped them off and drive back on their dime. It's highly unethical but when it comes to rides like that I find my ethics relax a bit more. Of course if lyft finds out they'll prob deactivate you."
UNLV,"My strategy is based on which property I am at and how far away the rideshare pickup spot is.  


Places like Cosmo have the rideshare pickup spot conveniently located so I use rideshare, places like the Linc or the Venetian, even Paris where the pickup location is less convenient, I find myself grabbing a cab real quick.  


For me it's all about convenience in the moment, not one overarching decision."
UNLV,"Most of the cab drivers are Dick Heads I had one guy watching a soccer match on his dash driving me all the way downtown from the airport. And they long haul you 

Most of the Uber and Lyft people are pretty good and you can always compare the two. Sometimes they get you on surge pricing but I’ve never had a problem with it.."
UNLV,Taxi from the airport an ride-share the rest of the trip.
UNLV,"Taxis are flat rate from the airport to your hotel/casino (Plus taxes/fees/gratuity):

https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG

Does need to be a direct trip though - requesting to stop at Lee's/CVS/Walgreens on the way will probably get you hit with the metered rate plus waiting charge, etc."
UNLV,use taxis for travel from the strip to other local places near the strip including downtown. Use uber/lyft for off strip rides.
UNLV,"Definitely recommend taxis at the airport. The rideshare pickup area is a crowded mess, but the taxi stand is super quick and organized, even during busy times."
UNLV,Thanks everyone!  This is very helpful.
UNLV,"If they ask you if you want to drive up the Strip, the answer is no. Shortest route. And get the price beforehand. Jerks."
UNLV,"Someone will probably answer your question more thoroughly, but the tl;dr will be definitely don't use taxis out here."
UNLV,"We got a taxi from the airport to the Strip and it was a flat rate of $24. 

For the rest of the trip we took Uber everywhere.  There are literally Ubers waiting at the hotels so you don’t wait long at all.  Very easy to get around."
UNLV,Who ever has the cheaper price at the time and it’s yes safe as anywhere else
UNLV,I've had no safety issues with either Uber or Lyft.  I just get annoyed at the wait times sometimes.  I prefer taking the bus from the airport when I'm staying south-strip... no safety issues there either.
UNLV,FYI sometimes a cab is actually cheaper and faster than rideshare. After a concert on Halloween it was over $50 for an Uber back to hotel and $15 for cab.
UNLV,"I always use Uber with others and alone in Vegas, never an issue"
UNLV,If I’m going between hotels or restaurants on the strip I take cabs. The placement of some of the u er/Lyft areas are not as easy to access at some hotels.
UNLV,Uber is my go-to transportation.
UNLV,"Taxis are still such a scam in Vegas. We went in October and the driver tried charging us an additional $7 above the posted rate. His excuse was that “they haven’t updated the signs with the latest prices” but he had a printed price sheet in the vehicle with inflated rates. Such a scammer! He was trying to charge us a flat rate of $26 to get from airport to Luxor. The uber cost us $13+tip. 

Taxis are just as unsafe as Ubers, and they’re notorious for ripping ppl off."
UNLV,"6 in one hand half a dozen in the other. Only story’s involving Uber or Lyft in the news here are passengers attacking drivers, so yea it’s safe."
UNLV,"The only time I might take a taxi over Uber/Lyft is from the airport to the strip. Sometimes the wait time for an Uber/Lyft is too long because you’ve got dozens of other people requesting one at the same time. The taxis from the airport are now a flat rate depending on which hotel on the strip you’re going to. They have the rates posted when you’re exiting the airport to go to the taxi line. For example, I believe we paid $25 flat from the airport to Paris. I think Uber/Lyft would still be cheaper if you don’t mind waiting, but when I arrive I am ready to get my vacation started so I don’t mind paying the extra to get moving right away.

Otherwise, Uber/Lyft is just fine for all your other travels within Vegas. It is safe, but as with any public transit, if you ever feel unsafe go with your gut. Between the two, Uber tends to be the cheaper service when I compare the two, but not by much. It also depends on surge pricing. If you have a Chase credit card, some of them offer 5% or 5x cash back on Lyft rides so that might be one reason to use Lyft over Uber."
UNLV,I spent $200 on uber in Vegas over memorial day weekend this year. Don't regret it. Haven't and don't use lyft in a while after I signed up for uber one.
UNLV,"I've used Uber a lot in Vegas, by myself or with my very elderly mother. Felt totally safe all the time. I tell her she's an Uber veteran. I've also used taxis there since 2000, and only had a minor issue once."
UNLV,I prefer Uber simply because I’ve had too many shady and slimy encounters when booking lyft. Including a scammer. Uber just worked better for us the last time we were there. Many drivers drive for both so it really shouldn’t matter.
UNLV,"Most drivers do both lyft and Uber.  You’ll see both logos on their dashboard.  Just pick whichever is cheaper. 

At most casinos the rideshare pickup will be at the back door.  Front is reserved for taxis because of years of graft."
UNLV,I feel safer in an Uber or Lyft than I ever did in a shitty taxi cab in Vegas
UNLV,I prefer lyft st the same price but whatever is cheaper. And it's always been safe for me
UNLV,"Just check both prices and go with the cheapest. Sometimes they're similar, but occasionally one is double the other."
UNLV,"Both are very good, I always go by whoever is cheaper at the time I’m looking for a ride"
UNLV,What's not safe are the taxi's.. Amateur formula 1 drivers from small countries all over the world.
UNLV,"Check cab fair, since a lot of drivers jumped ship and went to ride share a lot of cab companies have adjusted rates to continue operating.
Any option would be acceptable."
UNLV,Taxi
UNLV,I'd use Lyft/Uber over a Taxi any day. I typically use Lyft while I'm out there but both methods of travel are safe. My encounters with the drivers have all been friendly.
UNLV,"Whichever is cheaper at that particular time. Honestly, taxis are faster and cheaper (mostly).  I hate having to wait for an uber or lyft, especially if it ends up being a bit more expensive"
UNLV,"Yes they are safe but just as you should in any major city, be aware of your surroundings. Never put yourself in a situation where you are incoherent or can’t defend yourself."
UNLV,Taxi.
UNLV,"Just use taxis, it is so much cheaper"
UNLV,Taxi -- drivers have better stories.
UNLV,Taxi they are readily available and usually cheapest.  We were ubering in October.  But my 20 flat under ride to a casino was 15 in the taxi for the return trip.
UNLV,"I just got back from vegas and used Ubers the whole times, bit confusing finding the right pickup spot at first in bigger casinos - for either me or the driver. Leaving, the uber surcharged to $47 and the cab was $25 flat rate to the airport. So sometimes a cab can be cheaper."
UNLV,"I prefer taxi's .. the ubers and lyfts are always in crazy places but if you remotely know the city just take a taxi and it's fine.. figure 15 bucks to go anywhere but clear across the strip or to the raceway.  If they say ""i know a short cut just say no"""
UNLV,"Definitely check both at the airport.  Last time I flew in, Uber was almost double Lyft for the same trip due to surge pricing."
UNLV,I use both. Alone and with my husband. Have only had good experiences!
UNLV,"First 3 years I lived here, I didn’t have a car and primarily used Uber and Lyft. No issues. Use whatever is cheaper at the time of the ride. Hardest part is trying to find the ride share area at whatever casino you’re leaving from."
UNLV,"I usually pick whichever is cheaper and/or can arrive fastest. In my experience, there's never been a safety issues aside from a couple of super aggressive drivers."
UNLV,"Whichever can pick me up faster in the non-upgraded vehicle.  They are extremely safe.  I know you didn't ask, but I would (and do) choose ride share services over a cab every time.  In my experience cabs are not as clean, cabs are usually in worse mechanical condition and I have been ripped off by cab drivers several times that take non-direct routes.  Never had a problem with Lyft or Uber."
UNLV,The bus is cheaper a hot 5 dollas for all day
UNLV,I always do standard airport taxi to the hotel but Uber for different hotels and clubs on or off strip. The Uber rides have been great
UNLV,"Can to Cosmo was a
Little over $20"
UNLV,"Here is a map of flat rate pricing (for taxis) from the airport to resorts on the strip:

[https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider\_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG?n=698](https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG?n=698)

Depending on location, fares are between $19-$27 (plus tip, plus $1 fuel charge, plus $3 if you use a credit card)

&#x200B;

Great overview of taxi pricing in Vegas:

[https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare](https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare)"
UNLV,"It all depends cabs have been cheaper lately and are already parked waiting. Plus the price surge on Uber is insane for instance going to bellagio or leaving bellagio price hikes are insane, receipts to prove ."
UNLV,I’ve never had an issue.
UNLV,"They are both safe. Just make sure you check the plate and driver pic so you're in the right car. Recently, I've found Lyft to be cheaper, but you should check both apps everytime. For going to and from the airport, checkout the shuttles -- they are generally cheaper though you may have to wait a bit depending on when you arrive."
UNLV,"I am a retired professional chauffeur. (Limo driver, but extremely high end.) I do my best to never use Uber as they have not only charged me twice for rides, but then they also charged me for rides I never took. LYFT has never screwed me in any way. All the best of luck."
UNLV,"I personally prefer Lyft in Vegas because I find their service to be reliable and their drivers to be friendly. In terms of safety, both Uber and Lyft have safety measures in place, such as driver background checks and GPS tracking, which add an extra layer of security.

I also use [Vegas.com](https://govisit.click/vegas) for finding practically anything in Vegas lol. It's such a great, affordable option."
UNLV,Download them both and check which one is cheaper at the time you’re ready for your ride. I’d say 75% of the time Lyft is cheaper.
UNLV,"Most drivers usually do both anyway. Get both. They have surge periods where they charge more and thats where the drivers flock to. If your going to use it for house/bar hopping I would suggest do the wait and save option. I have over 100 rides this year and uber seems to respond much faster, and cheaper. ex I'm not waiting 20 mins plus to find a ride. (They have to find a ride for you, then you have your eta) I once waited an hour for a lyft. Now I know better. Everyone was on uber because of the surge, (Extra pay). Depending on distance, Uber or lyft may be cheaper. For closer rides lyft is cheaper but not as punctual, far rides uber forsure. Time of day also comes into play. Alot more people ubering then lyfting."
UNLV,Uber is cheaper than Lyft
UNLV,Lyft is good I think it’s cheaper
UNLV,Whichever costs less for you.
UNLV,"If you are renting, your rate card will be lowered a bit. I know when I was renting here in Houston my rate was lowered from 62 cents to 44 cents per mile. This was before upfront pay. They also taxed me 15% on tolls. I asked why and the Lyft rep basically told me it is what it is. He also said some markets don’t get a rate card reduction. Anyway 23 cents per mile is straight up criminal."
UNLV,Ideally someone would make an app where we pay $50 month and set our own rates and choose our own rides.   Not sure why that hasn’t been done yet
UNLV,"Instead of telling people to show you the rate card. Why don’t you site to us the specific law that is being violated? 

They’re paying people who are willing to drive for piss rates, piss rates. 

Quit driving for Lyft and paying out the ass for a rental while  being forced to accept shit rates to keep the rental. 

Go out and get a real job, while working on your credit. Get your own car. Then hop back in driving part time when you have a modicum of leverage to only drive during bonuses and streaks. You’ll make the same amount you’re making now, while spending a third of the time you do now on the road."
UNLV,Look the fact of the matter is. You are being paid less for renting. Is it fair? Hell no. Is it legal? Honestly I don’t know. Shoot even Uber doesn’t do that surprisingly. Why Lyft does? Cause they’re a shitty company
UNLV,We’ve got this upfront pricing scam here in AZ. The bastards are taking well over 50% of the fares and do it with impunity. Literally had a scheduled ride shoved in my queue. 15 min pick up ok no biggie. 65 bloody min drive after pickup and paid me $35.50. She paid over $100. Tick tock. I’m gone once the slowdown hits in May here and retired from this slavery BS were now enduring. After $2000 repair bill on my car and having to get a rental to work with this crap pay (I’d already quit for 2 months but new business has been slow and we’ve got SB and major golf tourney here next week).
UNLV,Yeah for 23 cents they better pay for my gas and give me the rental for free with unlimited miles lmfaooo foh with that!
UNLV,Bruh I was getting paid that when I rented from them. That’s crazy. I don’t know if I even want to get back on. I’ll just arbitrate and get my settlement at this point.
UNLV,Independent contractors Di not be need to be paid a minimum wage unless in California or Wash!
UNLV,I find it odd how many of you powerless drivers defend them screwing you over. It's very odd.
UNLV,"That's 2 honest people that have proven my case.

Thank you."
UNLV,"I'm actually an Award-winning documentary film PO producing loser thank you very much.

Unlike the reddit trolls laughably calling ANYONE a loser"
UNLV,"All I can say after that WEird encounter is

If you don't understand the Americans with Disabilities Act you're cheating yourself"
UNLV,No human deserves to be treated like garbage by a billionaire company. I feel sorry for some of you.
UNLV,"It's. Called ""negligent misrepresentation"" unless you can prove it was intentional"
UNLV,"You're a renter, so 23 cents per mile is true.  Get back to slaving !"
UNLV,WE'll find out I guess. Report 1 filed. I have a few other tricks up my sleeves.
UNLV,"For the record, my car is in the shop.

And the discrimination wasn't over a rental. I'm case anyone else is taking soneone named CIAmom420 or whatever seriously. It's about bonuses and rate cards. They need to be equal for all CONTRACTORS performing the same service level OR we are all being discriminated against LIKE employees.

And who cares if I can't spell? I have phat thimbs"
UNLV,Thats rape
UNLV,Mine is at $0.60 for a 2013 elantra.
UNLV,Lyft pays their drivers on average about 5 dollars an hour.
UNLV,"Rentals are only good as a temporary option. I only rented from Lyft back when it was $50 a week, plus good offers I found on HyreCar. Then I bought my own minivan for $2k."
UNLV,"Who cares, I get tips and kickbacks, and private rides where I keep 100%. Y'all ain't hustlers and need a w2."
UNLV,You’re making less per mile than the IRS determines the cost of running a vehicle is. Why would anyone work for those rates?
UPenn,"Is she a grad/med/law student? Otherwise, doesn’t really matter for undergrad since so many live on campus.

All busses run until about 12:30am, but some lines run all night. Could be once an hour or even less frequency, but they run.

Trolleys and subways also end around 12:30am. Though on weekends, MFL and BSL run 24 hours; I think starting Friday night.

Uber/Lyft are always available."
UPenn,"If she is talking about getting home from campus, Penn Transit has a few options. There’s two busses (one to West Philly and one to Center City) that run until midnight. There’s also shuttles that will pick up on campus and then bring her anywhere in a certain zone. [Here is the link for Penn Transit Services, there’s lots of transportation options in the area.](http://cms.business-services.upenn.edu/transportation/) "
UPenn,"As others have mentioned, Penn transit has buses that run from 5pm-12am monday through friday. The MFL goes till around 12am as well, and then the mfl routes transition to bus routes from 12 to around 5 or 6am."
UPenn,How late is late?
UPenn,It's late notice but can you tell the court you don't have a car and it's not easy for you to get there?  You might get excused.
UPenn,"you can pre-book rides on uber. I'd recommend doing that, some drivers prefer the long routes and less busy town streets"
UPenn,I have gotten multiple Ubers from state to altoona no problem
UPenn,This is the best place to ask that question. Best answers given.
UPenn,i’ll drive you for free where do you live
UPenn,"trust me, there are student who take uber/lyft all the way to JFK.

I've seen it with my friends, heard of it

cost is about $600-800, but as long as driver accepts it then its good to roll"
UPenn,"Did it about 5 years ago. Maybe $30 an hour. Not worth the wear and tear on your car. If you accurately track expense on good day clear $15 an hour(gas, wear and tear and damages)

Inevitably you end up in Philly and can either drive out w no fare or drive around the city."
UPenn,"I can only speak from the position of someone who used to take safety calls for one of these companies: Don’t. You’re better off delivering food or packages if you want to make extra money driving. 

There are drivers who have good experiences and make some extra money on the side but those are best case scenarios. There’s tons of things that can happen that will make these companies (or your car insurance company) leave you in the lurch.

I’ve talked to drivers who’ve had everything from bullets ripping through their cars cause their dumb ass passengers tried to use them as getaway vehicles from the dirt they were doing, to drivers who pull up to a domestic dispute and get a brick hurled through their window by some jilted woman. And with the increase in carjackings here in Philly, I wouldn’t risk it. 

Beyond that: wear and tear you put on your car isn’t worth it, and that’s before some clown pukes in your backseat or ruins your trunk/door slamming it."
UPenn,"Unfortunately, it's my full-time job until I land something more solid. I drive in South Jersey and Philly. Philly has become a little bit like the Wild West with all the car jackings.

Drive during daylight and in better neighborhoods. Before you start the ride turn off accepting other rides. Choose your areas carefully and be vigilant of people walking up on you, bumping into you, and of course, the potholes.

Stay safe!"
UPenn,"I live in Jersey but when I ubered in philly alot, I was not a huge fan. Especially going to certain areas. I straight up did not take rides to Kensington. I will say, I did enjoy picking up tourists though, and telling them places to go and talking to them. That was fun. Probably averaged 25 an hour. 

I stopped after a very very large woman with bedazzled jeans from wisconsin insisted on sitting up front, and she was so big that she barely fit in my mazda sedan and scratched the interior on the glove compartment with her gemstone jeans. 

Uber is not worth the wear and tear on your car in general."
UPenn,"I found a ""real"" job recently so I've stopped. Prior to that I was doing it full time overnight during quarantine and after. In a nutshell, you have to be choosy as hell and constantly vigilant. You need to be choosy because there's no point in driving 15 minutes to pick someone up trying to go 3 blocks away. You need to be vigilant because obviously the carjacking nowadays, but also while driving. Potholes made me have to swap out for a new set of tires twice in one year. Also, sometimes people are just straight up grimey. I specifically stopped driving old women around because some old lady's Depends leaked onto my backseat. Immediately took my car to a detailing shop and had them scrub my car over twice and sent the bill to Uber who was nice enough to credit me for the cleaning. Aside from that, I chose overnights because it's actually safer. Less drivers, all the roads are accessible, and if it's early in the night everyone's happy and has good energy and if it's really late then they're tired and won't really want to act up. Plus you get access to all the early morning airport runs which are much $$$."
UPenn,"Yes, but plan around 15 minutes for the nearest Lyft to make it to you."
UPenn,Booking in advance is also cheaper than finding a ride on time
UPenn,You can also reserve a future uber/lyft and they’ll assign someone to you to pick you up at that time so it’s guaranteed. I’ve never had an issue using this method.
UPenn,Yep.  Done this many times.  Schedule it using the app and you’ll be good.
UPenn,"I took an Uber from East Falls for a 6AM flight last week and it worked like normal. Caught it around 4, it was like $25-30"
UPenn,It depends where you live. Anywhere close to center city and or university city and you’ll get an uber in a matter of 5-10 minutes no problem
UPenn,These two services never stop running but in would check both to see which one has a car closest to you
UPenn,I’ve done uber at 3:30am. It was fine
UPenn,"I still use old-fashioned taxis for this, have been burned by Uber before. 

Scheduled a pickup for 4:30am, Uber came at 4:15 instead while I was showering and then left at 4:20 because he was ""waiting too long"". 

At least with a cab, they'll wait for you, they'll load your bags, they'll actually know how to get to the airport (this has been a problem with Uber) and it'll always be the flat rate."
UPenn,Are you checking a bag? You may want to check what time the counter opens to take bags. I think that might be at 4:30am. And I believe there is only 1 or 2 tsa screenings open at that hour as well.
UPenn,"It’s serious, be surprise how many drivers will accept the ride.
Why do you think every year they cut the pay?"
UPenn,I’ve been wondering about upfront pay and tolls on Lyft. With Uber the upfront pay offer they give doesn’t include tolls but they still pay you for it so you know their offer is actually what you’ll net after tolls. Now my question is does Lyft do the same thing ? I’ve taken a couple of trips that I wondered about toll payment and couldn’t remember the offer for the life of me to compare it with the earnings after the fact.
UPenn,Get rides to NJ from Philly all the time. That’s weird it’s only $12? Usually there atleast $18-22 for me going over the bridge
UPenn,"Tolls are **NOT** included in that Up Front ""earnings"".

After you do a trip including a toll open the Ride Summary for it and you'll see that the Tolls are all passthru to you, on top of the ""earnings"" you were quoted Up Front.

Just make sure to keep track of the Tolls for tax purposes, as it'll look like income if you don't deduct the expense of the tolls."
UPenn,32min fuckkkk that
UPenn,"Um, that route doesnt have tolls..."
UPenn,Of course they are serious about it 🙄 😒 😑 😐 🙃
UPenn,"The dare won’t include the toll because they want to see if they can get away with not giving it to you. Once the system sees you’ve gone over a toll bridge to complete the trip, it’ll add it after the fact."
UPenn,"Of course they are serious. We see that from the Jersey side constantly taking people to Philly. Then you guys get all the surging when the event is over and people need to come back. In addition, you can pick up rides on the way back. Jersey drivers can't.

Sounded harsh. Not at you, but it is definately a struggle from this side."
UPenn,"I live in Philadelphia, I drive in Pennsylvania. I’m just trying to straight up OPT OUT of rides that terminate in New Jersey! What paperwork do I have to submit? I don’t feel like doing it - maybe I will, but I’m definitely going to sign up for Uber first thing tomorrow morning. This app is telling me I can’t take a ride after I drop someone off in New Jersey! so much red tape… it wasn’t like this…."
UPenn,"Wish I knew about this a couple weeks back and paid for a lyft to an interview because I lowkey don't think I'm going to trust the subway for a long time. It was already on thin ice for me long before the pandemic for how gross it was half the time. I would have walked, but I was in a full suit. Ended up just walking home though"
UPenn,Lyft doesn't pay their drivers a fair wage or provide them adequate tools to stay safe on the road.
UPenn,Considering the whole city has public transit who is funding this?
UPenn,I hope they compensate the drivers for the tips they will miss on these. I tried driving for Lyft a while back and its not worth it if a passenger doesnt tip.
UPenn,"What if I take a Lyft to an ""interview""  downtown, tell them I got the job, then do I get free lyfts downtown for 3 weeks? Because that's not a bad deal... And I like taking advantage of shitty companies like Lyft wherever I can"
UPenn,"If you can prove you have a job interview in a reasonable way, I'll pay your taxi fare both ways + lunch, as long as you ride with someone who has a real medallion. I know it isn't perfect, but its something.

Limit 3 people, because I'm not that far from broke as fuck myself.

PM me if you think I'm playin.

Edit: I also live in Oakland, CA but have mad love for Philly so....  


EDIT: Honestly I don't care if its a real medallion, Uber, Lyft, two swallows gripping you by the hair, or you jog and bang two coconuts together. If I can somehow help, I'd love to."
UPenn,"No Lyft car would show up when I was paying for it (one Saturday evening a few months ago).

They fooled me once."
UPenn,Posts that start with so
UPenn,"Call me when Lyft or Uber or who the fuck ever decides to properly insure their drivers, then I’ll applaud. Great thing they’re doing with this program but their own business model has significant flaws that they need to focus on.

It’s fucking crazy that there are no checks and balances in place for that sort of thing.  People making money off this stuff realistically can’t afford proper coverage. Change my mind."
UPenn,"Remember when cabs provided a solid middle class wage, benefits, and were clean, safe, and regulated? 

Lyft turned a whole slew of careers into 1099 poverty ""jobs"" and is now trying to trick you into thinking they're on your side. They're not."
UPenn,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
UPenn,"Job interviews were my number one reason for using a Lyft a few years ago.

I realize a lot of people drive for Lyft and Uber at the same time but I've always preferred Lyft."
UPenn,"You can go to any college and create a startup, and even create one without going to college at all."
UPenn,"I don't want to sound too negative but suffice to say I don't think you've actually done any meaningful research on this topic.  

You could have a very healthy debate around which university is ***the best*** for startup culture & opportunity. Perfectly valid discussion.  

But I don't think an argument can be supported that in any way suggests that UPenn is unprepared or inadequately prepared to help support a good startup idea.

UPenn,You’re literally a sophomore focus on getting good grades and stuff now then research specific universities as your senior year gets closer
UPenn,Exactly what “research” did you do to come to this conclusion?
UPenn,"UPenn is #4 for Entrepreneurship and #1 for Business Programs and #1 for Finance, pretty high on all the other majors and minors that could be of interest to startup as well. Altho I would recommend not having your only deciding factor being ""founding a startup"", sure, you may create a Unicorn but you may also crash and burn (not saying you will, just saying it's a possibility), on a separate note, Babson college is #1 for entrepreneurship and has pretty good majors and from what I've heard a pretty entrepreneurial culture with 6% of students have started a company 6 months after graduation."
UPenn,You can start a startup anywhere but if you so inclined you should apply to peter thiel fellowship/scholarship you get 100k but you cannot go to college

UPenn,"I'm a social worker for families experiencing homelessness in Seattle, I was unaware of this program. Thank you for posting this! I'm sharing it with my director tomorrow, hopefully this program will be able to serve some of our clients! I appreciate you! 😊"
UPenn,"As a PA driver, I rarely accept trips over 5-6 miles long anymore since pay on any trips more than 15-20 minutes skews revenue down to below the IRS standard deduction of $0.655 per mile. I'm in Philly, however, so I usually just stay local. I guess it depends on how your part of PA is laid out."
UPenn,Getting a ride home might be a different beast entirely
UPenn,In the past you might have had better luck 🍀 now with the consistent pay cuts to drivers it might be harder
UPenn,"You should be fine scheduling a ride, there should be a driver that will take the ride."
UPenn,"There are private car services that you can contact. It it is 4 or less pax you can get a sedan. Just Google private car service near me. 

Drivers make shit on long rides and don't do it cash either t
You don't be covered by driver insurance Incase if an accident, and these rideshare drivers don't have the seats to cover your medical."
UPenn,"Ask yourself if you would accept a job to drive to a stranger then give them a ride from eastern Pennsylvania 50 miles away, 75 minutes for $40-50 then drive back home. (100 miles, 2.5hrs) and the gas comes out of your $40-50. This is the likelihood of a driver hitting accept.

Reserving a ride doesn't guarantee anything but you might get really lucky and get a driver who wants that ride. Maybe they have plans or are heading in that direction anyways so they don't have to make the trip back.

A tip is expected so the driver at least makes some money for their time and service."
UPenn,Some fool will accept that for $35
UPenn,You in Philly?
Northwestern,"Are you in DTC right now? If so, you talk to your professors about a place you need to travel for your project and then you take the Lyft there, so you don't have to pay for transit"
Northwestern,"I would assume this is for DTC, so your professors can explain it. It's basically so that if you need to go somewhere for your project (to interview project partners or clients, go shopping farther from campus, etc) you aren't paying for it yourself"
Northwestern,[deleted]
Northwestern,"I usually take the blue line a few stops then take a lyft from there, the prices go way down once you're away from the airport"
Northwestern,Blue line to red isn’t too bad of a train ride to Evanston edit: and about $2.75?
Northwestern,I always take a taxi! Much cheaper than uber
Northwestern,Bus is $2.50… I haven’t spent >$50 on ground transportation this year.
Northwestern,Just take the bus and ask ppl w a purple hoodie if they wanna split an uber should be tons of them at this time
Northwestern,Can’t help you there. But the [250](https://www.pacebus.com/sites/default/files/2023-10/Pulse%20Dempster%20Schedule%20Cover%20Sheet_Weekly%20Service%20All_0926SM_0.pdf) from Davis Street Station runs express now and only takes an hour. So if you’re looking to save money that’s the easiest and cheapest. A Lyft or Uber will be more like $40-50.
Northwestern,http://www.splitrideshare.com/ This originally matched people going to and from airports and NU. Looks like they upgraded it but i’ve used it a few times and it’s great
Northwestern,"I’ll second the bus; I took it every trip to O’Hare. While it can take a bit, it’s cheap af and there are points where busses get priority, I believe so it may actually be faster."
Northwestern,"People will tell you lyft or Uber but in my experience using O’Hare for the last 20 years, 303 taxis flat rate tends to be the cheapest. I ALWAYS check lyft and Uber just in case, but the flat rate from 303 taxi tends to be cheaper and you can look it up online"
Northwestern,take a taki trust me. they’re cheaper especially in the night time when uber and lyft rates are high. there’s a lot waiting right by the airport
Northwestern,Go online and order a taxi. It should be $35 flat fee
Northwestern,Pace bus
Northwestern,"Depending on the time, an Uber or Lyft could be like $30"
Northwestern,taxi may be cheaper but uber/lyft/taxi are all safe. if anything uber & lyft are more secure if you’re worried about that but either way you’ll be fine.
Northwestern,uberx for 30-40 bucks assuming your stuff can fit in the trunk or backseat of the uberx.
Northwestern,"Uber or Lyft. Idk what other apps exist lol. Never had any issues in terms of safety. Just always ask the driver who they are picking up before getting in, as well as checking the plates 

For school breaks like thanksgiving when everyone is leaving and arriving at the same time a lot of people coordinate on fb etc to share ubers/lyfts so it’s cheaper."
Northwestern,Probably uber at that point? I have seen a few people lug suitcases on the intercampus bus.
Northwestern,[deleted]
Northwestern,"I always arrive to OHare but midway airport is also fine. Having said that, given that your are international your flight is most likely going to land in O hare so I don’t think you will get to choose that. There is many ways to get to campus (subway, bus, etc.), but do yourself a favor a take a taxi/uber/Lyft since it’s the first time you are coming and I don’t think the stress of figuring out the transportation system in a new place is worth it. Uber can go from $40-70 depending on the day/time. Regarding money bring $100 cash in case your cards don’t work and you will need to pay anything in cash."
Northwestern,"Your visa allows you to get into the US up to 30 days before the program start date. Program start date usually coincides with the end of International Student Orientation (ISO) and is usually 10 days before classes being.  Look at your I-20 document and check the ""Earliest Admission Date"" field to be sure.

If you participate in ISO, you will get picked up and transported to campus from O'Hare by the university. There will be international peer advisors waiting for you at the airport at two different days, I would recommend planning for that when buying tickets. In case you make a connection flight inside the US, make sure to go Terminal 5 at O'Hare, which is where everyone should be.

ISO lasts 3–4 days and International Students have the entire campus for them. After that you participate in Wildcat Welcome with everyone.

I came here with literally 0 cash or any kind of money, and Office of International Student and Scholar Services (OISS) provided me with a prepaid card to cover all my initial expenses + a phone SIM card. I got my scholarship a few weeks later after setting up a bank account. Not the best scenario, but if you don't have money just email OISS and make sure they understand you will need their support for that."
Northwestern,"All of these are my own take from personal experience, so I can't guarantee they're the best. 

&#x200B;

I can't speak on how early you can fly in, although I do think international students get to come earlier.  I would recommend flying into O'Hare and taking a car to school (whether that's uber, lyft, taxi, etc.).  There are public transport options if that fits your budget better, but I personally hate getting on the bus/train with all of my bags.  I personally never use cash ever, but I would have like maybe $50 of emergency money in cash.  Good luck!"
Northwestern,"Things to get from home? Pretty much anything that makes you happy and reminds you of home. Basic/necessary stuff like bedding, toiletries, winter gear, etc. you will find here. The quarter system is rough and at some point you will miss home, so if there are things that you think will make it more bearable, bring them! For example, I wish that I had brought more snacks and food from my country when I came here for the first time. I also left a lot of clothes that I loved back home (because I thought they were not ""as necessary"" to bring) and was constantly thinking ""I wish I had this dress/shirt/etc. with me""."
Northwestern,"Ok so I’m my market LA flexdrive all included zero damage waiver (they’ve covered two nails in tires already charging and 90 personal miles (you can add more or keep the app running in the background declining requests) for an EV is a bit over $400 a week. You’re in for 20 rides min and get a $140 bonus if you do 90. Hitting 45-50 hours a week I make around $800-1000 a week profit. I have no worries about any other expenses except cleaning. Worth it to me but I work 70-80 hours a week between this and my other work. I always have but prefer doing this to just one job cause I’ve been in the same industry for 24 years, I was going through burnout and LA is pretty nice to drive around in."
Northwestern,"Buy a car. For real. It’s not worth it to rent. You’ll be working every day to pay that astronomical fee. 

Back in the day with Lyft the rental program was awesome. If you did 90 rides a week it was only $110 to rent. Unlimited miles. Whatever this express drive garbage is these days is asinine."
Northwestern,"if you want YOUR first car, you have to buy it. anything else is not yours. 

CNBC Sept 1 2023 average monthly payment of financed new vehicle in US approx $750"
Northwestern,"NEVER rent through uber or lyft, you'll lose money in the long run."
Northwestern,My rental is $250 lol. Paying $500 for a rental makes no sense
Northwestern,"Why? Driver pay is being cut every single year. Customer support is abysmal, at best. Lyft's future as an ongoing company is in doubt due to its mismanagement.

As an independent contractor you are liable for your income and self employment taxes. 15.2% of your income goes to SE taxes, and that's before you even start paying income tax.

Driving Lyft is a losing proposition. Only a fool would sign up to drive full-time at this point."
Northwestern,"Renting is twice as expensive as owning a car so unless you can put 250 miles every single day on an EV rental, you're better off buying"
Northwestern,"Rent a Car They Said. It will be fun, they said. Said No One Ever. 
Tesla 427.00 Per Week in the market, I drive in
Gas Vehicle not much cheaper. 

Do yourself a favor and buy something. But just know that the pay sucks. Not like it was in the early days of Goober. Uber/Lyft are taking 60 to 70%"
Northwestern,"I would use the Pace 250. The stop is  about a mile give or take from northwestern, but it is a straight shot from the airport and only costs $2.50"
Northwestern,American Taxi
Northwestern,"for the cheapest options, there's always the train or the busses. However, if you text in the c/o 2026 groupme when you're coming in, people can split the Uber cost with you and make it significantly cheaper per persob"
Northwestern,"If you want to avoid Uber, the best option would be Pace 250. 
Since you're international student, I assume you will arrive at terminal 5. Took the skytrain (ATS) to MMF (Multimodal Facility) then wait for Pace 250.
Ride 250 until Davis Station. If your housing is around south campus, I suggest you just walk from Davis Station.
But if your housing in north, I prefer to take L train - Purple line from Davis and stop at Noyes. (But you have to buy ticket or ventra in order to use L train)"
Northwestern,"Ubers from airport have been more expensive lately, I think because of gas prices."
Northwestern,"Pace 250 if you want to do public transit, I’ve only ever done it with a carry on size piece of luggage though. American taxi is the cheapest taxi I know of. Look them up and call ahead to book a ride a few days before you flight and they will give you a price. Last year I think it was around $35 for a van (I had two passengers and six pieces of luggage, so requested a larger vehicle)"
Northwestern,american taxi
Northwestern,"Ubers from the airport are either really expensive or fairly cheap. A lot of times really expensive. Always open the app to try though. If push comes to shove, you can take CTA Blue line to the Loop, switch to Red line toward Howard, and switch to Purple line at Howard to get to Evanston. Look at Lyft too. The CTA commute is a doozy."
Northwestern,Taxi from the airport will be cheaper than an uber if you don't want to sit on the bus or train for a millenium.
Northwestern,"If you want a faster ride, you could take the blue line to the loop (Jackson), then red line to Howard and purple to Foster. At that point its just a walk east to campus. However, taking the L does involve more transfers and a bit more expensive.

Otherwise, the 250 will work just fine, but it is a bit further walk to campus. I've lived in Chicagoland all my life and taken both the L and CTA, so if you got any more questions about the area/etc I can help."
Northwestern,try posting it on [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) there's ride-sharing!
Northwestern,CTA Blue Line costs $2.75 and takes you right downtown.  Get off at Clark and Lake.
Northwestern,"[https://www.northwestern.edu/international/international-students/preparing-for-arrival/travel-to-northwestern.html](https://www.northwestern.edu/international/international-students/preparing-for-arrival/travel-to-northwestern.html)

Literally the first google search for ""O'Hare to Northwestern international student"" shows you the main page for international students which tells you everything.  There are literal pages of this shit written by PROFSSIONALS (OISS staff) just for international students like you and yet you choose to use reddit instead.

Again, a lazy ass question with 0 effort or research into it. It would have been quicker for you to google it than write out that entire reddit post.

Northwestern,"Honestly, that’s a baller response. 

What are they supposed to say? “Oh no! I better go apply at the Home Depot!!!”

Naw. I dig it. “Rely on someone else’s lack of effort.”"
Northwestern,What an ass lol.
Northwestern,Her response reads like she didnt read the reddit post lol
Northwestern,NWM is a cult. CMV
Northwestern,That recruiter is on a lot of copium
Northwestern,Link to the post? I want to read it.
Northwestern,"""paid training program"" as if that isn't the absolute bare minimum for a non-MLM employment scenario"
Northwestern,"I interviewed there.   Wasn’t really an interview as they had us all in a room and told us to come back in a week with a list of all our friends and relatives.  None of my friends or relatives had any money, so I noped right out of there. 

Yea, first sales job, and I have to do all the lead generation on my own? Fuck that"
Northwestern,She sounds exactly like what I would expect from a NWM recruiter.
Northwestern,Their “paid” internship is $100 a week here in Texas (40 hr week) while you’re forced to cold call all of your mutuals to sell life insurance packages. I got offered the position this summer but thankfully realized it was a horrible situation.
Northwestern,"It’s honestly weird how mad you all are at for a recruiter doing their fucking job lol. You think these people all love their jobs or is it more likely they’re just like you, just working to get by. Your collective anger is misplaced…"
Northwestern,Kudos to you
Northwestern,Anywho 🤓
Northwestern,"Thank you for sharing this friend 

I switch fields and had rotten luck this year applying for internships. I did a few training programs to help me out, but I'll never forget about how high Northwestern raised my hopes and expectations. I even wore my suit for the Zoom interview and texted my girl it went great

Yeah it sucked learning what it really was, but thanks again for sharing this"
Northwestern,"Getting started as a financial adviser is a really tough gig. Most people don’t make it. That said, NWM isn’t nearly as bad as others I’ve seen. Met many great people working there but it’s not a job for people who don’t like rejection or making cold calls. I’m fact, it’s not for people who aren’t made to be salesmen."
Northwestern,I stg nobody cares about their job more than HR.
Northwestern,How do these companies stay in business?
Northwestern,MLM BossPerson vibes
Northwestern,bootlicker behavior tbh
Northwestern,LMAOOOO
Northwestern,She spun it and deflected pretty well tbh but yeah stay away
Northwestern,"My former boss, great guy, left our job for NWM. He was making around $55,000 to $60,000 at the company we were at, to practically nothing with NWM... and he had three kids. He's very good with people and decent at sales imo and had to leave after just a few months with them because he was barely scraping by on a few hundred $ a month, even after exhausting all of his family/friend/business contacts. I tried to warn him ahead of time but also didn't want to be too negative on something he was excited about trying."
Northwestern,I need this level of confidence.
Northwestern,Such a good response tbh
Northwestern,That was a really good response .
Northwestern,"It’s funny how I’ve never seen any NWM hate until now, but I arrived at the same conclusions via a job interview.  Interview went well, but then it got to my questions.  What kinda leads will I be given?  Friends and family brought up instead of saying we have a way to train you to cold call.  Mentorship?  Maybe.  Sub par CFP affiliations.  Compensation?  $30k stipend for 6 months then all commissions and 25 bps per deal till they think I deserve more.  When I brought up the Merrill program is just better, they said yeah but Merrill has you raise $3mm in a year or walk; to which my reply was no it’s actually $10mm but let me ask you: Do you think I fit better here or in the Merrill program?  It took five questions to ruin this lady’s day.  I actually really liked her as a person."
Northwestern,LOL now double it and send her this post
Northwestern,It gets a lot of flack on here and probably rightfully so but I did a summer internship there and didn’t find it to be a waste of time. It wasn’t as prestigious as Goldman Sachs but it did teach me how to do cold sales and networking. I closed 6 policies if I remember correctly and also remember getting paid pretty well from those. Especially for a college kid. I also got close with some of the full time advisers and I know they were making good money. Maybe other offices are different though.
Northwestern,I can smell the gaslighting from here
Northwestern,"Idk I worked for a financial advisor and even considered getting my CFP. I got away from it because I could get a higher, more reliable income from my main professional skill (tax). I just didn't see myself starting from scratch as an advisor, ever.

But companies like NWM are intentionally deceitful both with the sales people and potential clients. They stick people in products that don't fit them and misrepresent your earning potential. 

The intentional manipulation and predatory nature just gives me the ick"
Northwestern,"OP here. Can verify that it was my lack of effort, not huge ethical concerns and a way better job, that made me leave."
Northwestern,"Any recruiter that uses “anywho” is probably not someone you want to trust with your career.

Frankly, people who use “anywho” probably shouldn’t be trusted with any part of the major decisions in your life either."
Northwestern,So many issues with FINRA not being able to oversee companies like this.  Anything not FDIC insured should fall under FINRA and SEC purview.
Northwestern,Lmao dumb cunt doesn’t even understand how their own firm works
Northwestern,[deleted]
Northwestern,Legend
Northwestern,"My best friend started at NWM right out of college.  D1 athlete.   Really smart guy.  That was fifteen years ago.   After the second year, his older brother joined him.   Five years later, his younger sister quit her six figure SaaS customer success role and joined them.   They are great people and I’ve never seen them happier.    They do very well financially.    The first two years most people do not survive"
Northwestern,"it's like that other offshore pwm company, after researching online they also had a bad reputation but I brush it off as I wanted to get a foot in the door for finance planning, on paper they sounded good as they also help you get certs to become a financial planner and I needed a job. But then had during the interview they emphasized how much of sales it's actually going to be, how I had to join a training (all paid by me) and even not getting a salary, I didn't mind it at first as I was genuinely interested.

Then I pass to the next phase, which was a ""livestream"" with the CEO that I couldn't miss or even be late to join. I try to join on time as it was very ""important"", I mean it's the CEO right? I shouldn't waste his time. However, I had some connection problems and emailed the interviewer for another date, he sounded a little bit annoy but sent me another link (couple of hours later). I join and realize it was a stupid webinar.

Then it all hit me, a CEO would not do a livestream to explain the business to barely candidates, specially because I was in Asia, he was supposed to be in Dubai's HQ and they had offices globally, he isn't going to spend random times of the day having a livestream. So the fact that they even lie for a webinar gave me a huge red flag. After the webinar they send you a cringy behavioral questionnaire, I could see how I could select the answers they wanted to hear but I decided to choose the one actually met my personality and didn't get an answer back which I was happy about."
Northwestern,"Spoken exactly like the typical pyramid scheme. If you fail, it's not the company - it's your fault. You will succeed in the position of you're absolutely shameless and lack empathy."
Northwestern,"I mean, she's not wrong!"
Northwestern,Name this woman lol
Northwestern,Glorious
Northwestern,Fairfield County gang
Northwestern,"Stamford, where is that?"
Northwestern,Link to the original post share with the recruiter please?

Tufts,I should write a bot to buy/sell stock in Uber based on MBTA alerts.
Tufts,Gotta get that Lyft XL
Tufts,It would be cheaper to rent a car for the day.
Tufts,I should drive for Lyft.
Tufts,I walked back home and drove to work. $40 parking plus close to an hour drive from Quincy Adams.
Tufts,it's honestly hard to say these days which is worse: being trapped in your car 2 hours each way to go 10 miles or hoping and praying your train/bus shows up and doesn't have a major incident.
Tufts,"Express Bus 326 in Medford, straight to Haymarket you could walk from there to Kendall in like 20 minutes."
Tufts,[deleted]
Tufts,That XL is only $10 a person if you get 5 others to split it with you
Tufts,"You aren't in traffic...

You are traffic."
Tufts,The craziest part about this is that it's at the completely opposite end of the line from the derailment and service interruption.
Tufts,Uber diamond coming in strong. 20 dollars to get me to work here.
Tufts,Comparable Uber:  $125.99
Tufts,hAvInG a cAr iN bOsToN iS a WaStE

Tufts,"Gee, I can't wait for that techbro innovation to make taxis better and cheaper"
Tufts,Isn’t price gouging illegal?
Tufts,Look at how many cars there are. There was simply not enough drivers to handle the demand.
Tufts,r/BostonRideShare
Tufts,lol walk
Tufts,https://www.lyft.com/drivers/KAYLA538?utm_medium=d2di_iacc guaranteed $950!!!! Also passengers use DRIVERSMAKEBANK TO GET $5 off!!!
Tufts,Yep I was getting similar from Somerville to Boston
Tufts,Commuter rail ffs.
Tufts,There are these cars with drivers called taxis that by law do not change their pricing during busy times. I'd suggest calling one since nobody else is.
Tufts,[deleted]
Tufts,Stop using Lyft/Uber then?
Tufts,Uber/Lift are perfectly reliable at that hour. 
Tufts,"Depending on how much luggage you have, and how early you need to get there, public transportation wouldn't be too bad. I've never taken an uber that early so I can't speak to its reliability. If you don't mind paying extra, there are several cab companies in the area that you can reserve a day in advance if you want extra piece of mind. I've taken a cab from Tufts to the airport countless times, and it's usually $40."
Tufts,Tufts what?
Tufts,Uber / Lyft should be fine especially now that with at least Uber you can schedule a pick-up. I usually just wing it and request a ride 15 minutes prior to when I need to leave the house to catch 7AM flights and haven't had a problem yet. 
Tufts,"Uber is very reliable, I've gotten rides to the airport at like 3-4 am with them after maybe a 5 minute wait of requesting."
Tufts,"I live right next to Tufts and I have taken Uber to the airport a couple times. You're in luck because it's a ridiculously easy and fast ride, without traffic you can be door to door in 15 minutes. You just hop on 93 S. and it takes you right there.

If you take UberPool it will only be about 12 bucks (or less if you get UberPlus)

I have found Uber and lyft to be very reliable nearly 24/7

"
Tufts,You can reserve uber-x ahead of time. No need to do anything else
Tufts,"From Tufts Uni:

Walk or get an Uber to Davis, depending on your location. 

Ride Red Line to South Station

Silver Line to Logan.



Honestly if your looking to catch a flight, take an Uber at around 5-6 am. The traffic is less and it's usually done with the overnight surge. You can just stay at the airport and do work or just chill. I got to Logan 4 hours early, and I just played Civ V until my flight. 


Edit: Uber's about $20. I live near Tufts (Hillside) so I'm assuming it might be the same/less."
Tufts,"Public transportation is a reliable way to get to the air port from there. Walk to davis, then red line to silver line. Considering you'll be leaving early, the T should not be too crowded by that point. But traffic will also be light, so Uber would be faster."
Tufts,"The shuttle this year is shit. It says it runs every 20 minutes but sometimes I sit in Davis for over 35 minutes and it doesn't come (not even when the shuttle is on a break). The problem is that the every twenty minutes.timeline is extremely unreliable. Precovid, when there were time schedules and more than just two stops, it was much better"
Tufts,The shuttle service currently only goes from Davis to the campus center. I personally think the timing is unreliable but the overall service is decently reliable. If the shuttle is running it will be at the stop within 15 min of anytime basically. The actual posted times on the app are not that accurate always but usually pretty close

Tufts,"From Tufts you’d be better off hiking in the Middlesex Fells than Blue Hills, but you wouldn’t also get to see Milton. The Northern Suburbs are cool too. https://ase.tufts.edu/xctrack/xc/fells/fells.asp

Most of Tufts is ~15-20 minutes from Davis Sq. On the red line, which will take you into Cambridge and down to Park St or South Station where it’s a short walk to the Rose Kennedy Greenway (parks over the Big Dig)."
Tufts,"It seems you’re into transit stuff. You might want to go to Boylston Station - there’s a side track that has some old train cars on it. If you want to go on a longer trip, go to Ashmont on the Red Line and take the Mattapan Line. You might want to go to Ward Maps in Cambridge - they have a lot of maps, but also sell a lot of old MBTA knickknacks that you might enjoy looking at, or even buying."
Tufts,"In April the sun sets at about 19:30 in Boston, something to keep in mind. You say you'll be over-caffinated, but be aware that the T shuts down at midnight. 

Will you have a Tufts ID? You can get into some museums like the MFA for free with a university ID. 

Newton: Get off the T at Eliot and meander through the neighborhoods to Newton Centre. Will give you a good flavor.  
PRO TIP: if you have an unlimited ride pass take the B to Chestnut Hill Ave and walk to Reservoir and change to the D or take the C to Cleveland Circle and walk to Reservoir. The views from those trains are much better than on the D, and those stations are like 5 minutes apart, and will give you a much better idea of the city. Take the B one way and the C the other. B goes by BU and where younger people live (Allston/Brighton). C goes through Brookline which is a wealthier area, but much denser than Newton. 

You can cover Big Dig (Greenway), Downtown, Back Bay, Harvard, and MIT in a day if you push yourself. If you take the SL1 from the airport to South Station you'll actually go through one of the Big Dig projects. 

Being brown: In the places you're mentioning there is no reason to be concerned. You have to remember that Boston welcomes a ton of people like you every year. Problems with police are also not as bad in Boston as in other areas of the US. If you're still nervous, buy a sweatshirt or hat that says ""Tufts"" on it and and you'll be invisible. 

Hiking: honestly I would make this the first thing you cut from your trip for time. Unless you've never been in a forest before it's not that impressive.

If you want to splurge go see a Red Sox game."
Tufts,I have no advice to add but congratulations on getting into the program!
Tufts,"Congratulations on your accomplishment!

Please go to the [Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum](https://www.gardnermuseum.org/). It is unlike most other museums. Long story short, at the turn of the 20th century, Isabella Stewart Gardner was wildly wealthy and spent her time buying art and antiquities and building a home to house them. Her ""home"" was modeled after Venetian Palazzos and is stunning with a full indoor garden on the first floor. It is quite an amazing place even if it is a prime example of cultural imperialism. 

You will need proof of vaccination to enter the museum."
Tufts,"Congrats on getting into your program!

I don’t have much to add except to say it’s refreshing to encounter someone so excited by Boston.  I’ve gotten pretty jaded living here and sometimes it’s nice to get an outside perspective. I really hope you enjoy your time here!!"
Tufts,"You seem more well researched than most folks. Your ideas for fun seem fine. 

Don’t worry about race and what you wear. You won’t have any issues in Boston, especially near Tufts. 

Davis Square is great. If you are at Tufts, feel free to wander all the fun bars there. Lots of Tufts kids go to Davis for lots of socializing. I don’t know whether it’s a thing during Covid, but the Burren in Davis used to always have a super fun 80’s/90’s cover band playing in the backroom on Thursdays."
Tufts,"Skip Milton it's not easily accessible by T. If you really want to go to Newton, you can take the D branch of the Green Line. I advise picking an actual destination, not just going to a town and expecting to be impressed. For example, you could pick Boston College as a destination. There is a reservoir and nice houses around there."
Tufts,"As someone who grew up in Milton skip it unless you are set on hiking Blue Hills. People there like to think they are wealthy but it no way compares to Newton, Wellesley or Weston. Also if you are staying close to Somerville Milton is tough to access by public transportation(no buses or trains go to Blue Hills). If you have a car it is right off the highway. 

I’d recommend visiting the North End in Boston to see a cool little neighborhood with great Italian food. Chinatown/theatre district also has some great eats.

Best of luck!"
Tufts,"I love the Back Bay area. I would recommend taking the redline to Park Street, walk through the Commons to the public garden then walk down Comm Ave for maybe 4-5 blocks in the middle greenway, and then switch to Newbury St (still walking in the same direction to Mass Ave. there’s great people watching on Newbury. When you get to Mass Ave, take a left and stop at Pho Basil for excellent Vietnamese/Thai food. It’s usually packed so takeout might be best. Keep walking down Mass Ave and go to Wally’s Cafe (if it’s open) for some great live jazz. Be careful wandering too much around Wally’s at night. Methadone Mile isn’t far away and there can be a fair amount of crime. I’d probably take an Uber when leaving Wally’s if it’s late. 

I also love walking around Castle Island. Hell, really just walking around Boston. No better way to see a city, especially Boston being so walkable"
Tufts,"Oh I forgot to mention, Boston to NYC via Amtrak can be quite expensive. The Chinatown buses or the GO Bus are quite a bit cheaper ~$20-$30 each way and can be faster since they don’t stop along the way. The fast Amtrak/Acela is closer to $100 each way.

Getting around NYC can be difficult for a visitor unless your place to stay happens to be in Manhattan. Hopefully your host can help you get around."
Tufts,"1.	You definitely have a better grasp of the US than most visitors I’ll tell you that much 
2.	As a gay man in Boston, I’ll say that the gay bar here isn’t bad but it’s not the best either. Club cafe is the biggest one and it’s fun but I prefer the ones in Manhattan 
3.	I get the racism worries, I’m Brazilian and my family worried a lot too but for the most part, if you consider yourself “white” in South America and you’re from a social class that could get into a program in the US, then you’re not as likely to get profiled as you think.
4.	American college parties are not that great tbh. They range in quality and it’s spread by word of mouth. So unless you already have a group of friends here waiting for you, you’re not guaranteed to find one."
Tufts,"Currently a graduate student in Urban Planning at Tufts, glad you're going to be able to make it! Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about your plans or anything.

A few thoughts:

1. The esplanade is a nice place to walk (along the Charles), with good views of the skyline, and can be combined with the public garden and Back Bay really easily.  
2. Jamaica Plain might satisfy your interest in both suburbs and nature - it's a place a lot of young people live, has some really nice parks (the Arboretum, which was designed by Frederick Law Olmstead, a famous landscape architect, and Jamaica Pond), and also good food and bars
3. The Southwest Corridor, which runs from the South End (area with a lot of pretty brownstones) down to communities further south is a linear park with an interesting history, there was a highway planned to be put there in 60s until the communities revolted and instead a subway line (Orange) and a park were built. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest\_Corridor\_Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwest_Corridor_Park)
4. Sonia (and the Middle East Complex in general) are great places to see shows and in a nice part of Cambridge (Central Square) with great nightlife. Also partial to the Sinclair in Harvard Square, and the Paradise Rock Club in Allston.
5. I don't know for sure, but Tufts has been pretty strict around covid precautions - I imagine the party scene on campus is much dampened from when I was an undergrad, but there are a number of fraternities on campus still.
6. Amtrak is very expensive (often more so than flying) if you don't have an advance ticket - I think if you book at least a few weeks out its much cheaper. Otherwise, there are buses that go from South Station to Times Square for less than 20 dollars usually, and aren't too bad. It's a long trip for one night though, I'm not sure I'd do it."
Tufts,Make sure you bring proof of COVID vaccination…maybe this will change soon but as of now you need to show your vaccination card to go to a lot of places in the Boston area.
Tufts,"If you’d like to see the “burbs” I would take the C and D lines of the Green Line. Take the C to Coolidge Corner and walk all around. Get bagels at Kupels (just ranked one of the best in the country), donuts at Union Square (not my FAVORITE in the city but still delicious), pizza at Ottos, or a sandwich at Zaftigs. Then get back on the C and ride up to Cleveland Circle and do the same. If it’s nice enough, walk from CC to the BC campus. Then get on the D at Reservoir (right by Cleveland) and ride west. Best option would be Newton Centre. Then just meander there for a while. 

And don’t worry about race. Boston’s racism isn’t outright and awful like the south. It’s more intrinsic and long standing in financial and economic which shouldn’t affect you in terms of your visit. 

Overall though just enjoy! You’ll love it"
Tufts,"The bus to NYC is way cheaper than Amtrack.  It'll take a longer though.  Or the flight takes like an hour and isn't really any more expensive than an Amtrak ticket.  Trying to NYC in a week already packed with Boston site seeing seems a bit like overkill, but you could try going at the end and then flying home out of JFK or La Guardia."
Tufts,"The advice here is all awesome. I am so happy for you! Seems like you have a very great grasp on Boston. My only two additional pieces of guidance are:
1.) spend at least 3 days, if not longer, in NYC. Stay in a hostel to save money so you can focus on doing other fun stuff. The gay scene will be 1000x better.
2.) If your visa allows you to extend your stay - and you can afford it - try and tack on an additional week or two. It will allow you to explore at a more reasonable pace. In 4 weeks you could have the time of your life exploring Boston > NYC > Philly > DC"
Tufts,"Boston is a very walkable city. If you’re staying at Tufts you can take the redline in to downtown crossing and walk to Newbury St through the park. 

Newton Center can be reached on the green line and is textbook wealthy American suburbia. Make sure to grab an iced coffee or a green juice to complete the experience. 

If you’re right on money a bus might be your best bet to get to NYC. Leave early in the morning to maximize your time there."
Tufts,"Hi there! Congratulations- also, good book choices. Robert Allison was my college professor at Suffolk University in Boston. His free recommendation would of course be the freedom trail. This would be good for your walking goal- it brings you through all the major historical parts of Boston. 

If you’re currently a highschool or college student back home, make sure to bring your student ID. Many museums are free if you have the time. 

Newton- go see Boston College and walk around their campus. You can take the green line here. From Tufts, you could either take the orange line or the commuter rail from West Medford. 

b) Amtrack is wonderful, but if you’re looking to stay on a budget we have Greyhound busses that go to NYC. Not glamorous, but it will get you there.

C) Boston is incredibly diverse, nobody will bat an eyelash at you. 

D) College parties (re: Fraternity parties like in Allston or at Tufts) don’t end “early” but probably to you- 2am is usually the shutdown time. I know you all go much longer."
Tufts,"Check out Brookline if you have time, nice blend of affluent suburb and denser housing. You can take the green line to Coolidge corner and have a nice walk around"
Tufts,Club Cafe for an awesome gay club.
Tufts,"Hey I'm nobody but I have a very serious offer, love to buy you dinner and hear your story/drive you around when you get here!"
Tufts,"Be careful of creating too large of a schedule, I recommend trying to remove or combine a couple things from your list, so you can stay flexible.

For example, I don't think it would be worth it to go to Milton or Newton. If you want to see some upper class suburbs, walk from Harvard Sq down Mount Auburn St to get to Mount Auburn Cemetery (2km walk). On your way down Mount Auburn St, explore some of the side streets there (such as Channing St or Lowell St) to see some beautiful homes worth several million dollars. Then take your walk at Mount Auburn Cemetery. This way you accomplish two things on your list in one ""outing"".

I wouldn't make a special trip to Sonia, but it depends on what else is going on.

Final thought, try your best to get to NYC for a day. You would be missing out if you visited the United States, and were this close to our flagship city and didn't make it there. If money is an issue, you can get a roundtrip bus ticket on Peter Pan or Greyhound bus lines from Boston South Station to New York Port Authority for around 60 dollars. Keep checking the prices because they change over time, once you see the price around $60-$70, book it, because they don't get much lower than that. For accommodations try couchsurfers.com if you don't want to pay for a hotel or airbnb."
Tufts,"Congratulations! Lots of responses already but feel free to PM me, I'm on the faculty at the Medford campus."
Tufts,"If you are here the 3rd week in April, that is the week of Patriot's Day, the celebration of the beginning of the American Revolution. There are a bunch of activities in Lexington and Concord that week and it is also the week of the Boston Marathon."
Tufts,"A ton of great recs here.  
My top places -

Esplanade, particularly Cambridge side around the Mass ave bridge (great views of Boston skyline)

Greenway - this is the park that replaced 93 when the Big Dig was finished. Brings you from TD Garden/Zakim bridge past the North End, Aquarium, Faneiul Hall, and ends in chinatown. 

If you want to look around suburbs, I'd recommend Brookline, it's pretty similar to the rest of the suburbs but much more accessible. Unless you have a car it'll be hard to get around different suburbs.

Feel free to DM me if you have specific questions. I've been around here a while and am currently a Tufts student."
Tufts,"First, congratulations!    
    
My polite suggestion is skip Milton & hiking, we do have some great areas for it but with your short trip I think you can prioritize other sights that are easier to get to.    
However if you're going to Harvard, you can tour Harvard square, walk down Brattle street, and end up at the Fresh Pond Reservation area. Brattle street is well known for it's large houses, it's not the suburbs but it is very upscale. Size and architecture is similar to the upscale homes in Newton. After visiting Fresh Pond you can walk to the Alewife train station.     
With your packed itinerary and limited time this would be very efficient. Longfellow house is along Brattle street as well.    
Edit:.   
I wouldn't worry too much about race with any of the areas listed. If you have gotten drunk before you can skip partying, which will reduce the odds you'll see the police."
Tufts,"You've clearly done your research and I'd say you're sure to have a blast here! There's already a lot of good suggestions here but I'll add some advice as well.

Your itinerary looks *packed*. I don't know what your symposium schedule looks like but make sure to leave some time to hang out with some of the other students there! You'll presumably be meeting a bunch of very smart people, so that's gonna be fun itself.

From Medford, you'll probably be taking a bus or walking to the red line for most locations. You sound like a transit enthusiast, and there are a lot of us here. The MBTA could be better but once you get to the trains, it works pretty well most of the time. It's great for exploring the city, but I would bear in mind that it's going to take you ~30 minutes to get into the city center, where you'll have to transfer to get to a lot of different locations. You can definitely get wherever you want to go, but you can pack more things in the closer you look to where you'll be staying. I'll echo what others are saying about Davis. Lots of cool places, and it's close, which will be very helpful timewise. That said, I'd definitely spend a day just wandering downtown if you can. Get off the red line at Charles/MGH, and walk down Charles St. to the Common. From there, you can go through Downtown Crossing to the North End (grab a bite to eat here if you can), then you can walk along the shoreline in either direction to your heart's content. I'd circle around to the Seaport district, which is new and a bit ""fake"" but does have some cool stuff to do.

I know you mention that you'd be okay sleeping very little to explore more but there's not much to explore after midnight. Boston is a very early city, and it's not always easy to get around without a car after 12:30. I've had success using Blue Bikes to get home late, but that's not really a great way to get all the way out to Medford, *especially* if you've been at bars. Ridesharing apps like Uber/Lyft work well but can get pricey. Don't know how much you've budgeted for getting around while you're here, but rideshares can add up quick depending on when you're ordering them.

I'd second others mentioning that you should have some destination when you're headed out to the burbs. You can for sure go for a nice walk out there (I used to run out to Brookline/Newton a ton when I lived in Fenway) but unless you're in a built up area it's mostly just houses. Brookline in particular has a nice balance of suburban homes and things to do, so personally I'd take the D branch to Beaconsfield/Reservoir and walk around Fisher Hill if you want to see a wealthy suburb still in T-range. It'll take you a ~45min-1hour to get there from Medford, and if you wanted to walk around Newton Centre it would take you about an hour to get there on the T.

If you want to do NYC you will have to budget 4-5 hours of travel both ways (once you account for the 30 minutes from Medford to/from South Station), which means that to really do it efficiently you'd have to take a bus/train early in the morning and late the next day. That's a lot of time traveling (8-10 hours) given that you're only here a week and a half but I've done more travel in less time so you just have to weigh that versus what you could be doing in Boston during that time. I grew up in NJ so I've taken every possible mode of transportation between Boston and NYC (well, I haven't sailed between the two, but you get the point). Amtrak is best but also usually most expensive, for some reason. Buses are very hit or miss experience wise but tend to be the cheapest by a wide margin.


On point **c**- I don't think you'll run into issues. Boston has a (sometimes deserved) reputation as a racist city but a lot of the issues are systemic. Not saying that we don't have racist individuals here either, but they're not too common and you shouldn't run into issues as a tourist.

On point **d**- I'm one of the many students that came to school here (at Northeastern) and stayed after I graduated. College parties can differ a lot depending on what college you go to and what your friend group looks like, but in my experience, partying at a college in the city involves going an apartment, drinking a little (or maybe a lot), and talking to whoever ends up in your line of sight. It's a mixed bag, depending on who's hosting. Sometimes it's a blast, sometimes you leave early to get blitzed at your favorite bar instead.

Hope this helps! If you have any other questions feel free to ask. I know this ended up a bit rambly but I travel in the same way (just exploring around) so I hope this helped give you a lay of the land a bit."
Tufts,"Congrats!

I tried to skim the other replies, but I know I’ll still say a few redundant things, sorry I’m advance for that. If I do, just take it as a +1 for whatever suggestion I’m repeating!

You have limited time. Maybe one long T/train trip is ok, since “riding the T” is probably one of your to-do items, but I wouldn’t make every day a T day.

I’d make sure you are focusing most on the reason you are coming: the symposium. There’s lots of great stuff close to Tufts that might even be fantastically walkable in April, depending on your luck.

A 10-15 minute walk from the Tufts main campus, Davis square (and some spots in its neighboring squares) is great for food and nightlife.

I’d skip Milton, Newton, Quincy, or any “far” stuff. If you want to see posh houses, check out “Tory Row” on Brattle Street in Cambridge. In addition to the historical mansions, there whole area is flush with some impressive dwellings.

Also check out Professor’s Row and Julia Child’s house in Cambridge. They’re close to Harvard. Beacon Hill in Boston is also highly swanky, though you won’t find many big yards.

Do Mt Auburn Cemetery instead of Blue Hills. Blue Hills is more “natural”, ~~but the cemetery is basically a national treasure of landscaping, designed by a famous American landscape architect (Olmstead).~~ but the cemetery is notable as being the country's first ""rural"" (or ""garden"") cemetery in the US. It is credited with inspiring other, similar cemeteries as well as helping kickstart the whole parks and gardens movement within the country. It was designed by group of gentlemen..less famous than Olmstead, so I'll leave their credit to the cemetery's [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Auburn_Cemetery). And it’s a lot closer to Tufts.

Basically, I’d stick to Tufts, Davis Square, “Cambridge” (for the neighborhoods plus Harvard and MIT), and downtown Boston, where you can just follow the Freedom Trail, which takes you by the most famous historical sites and definitely cuts across the parks created by the Big Dig.

These are tourist-101 items for visiting, but it makes sense to see them, since you’ve never been to Boston before.

More than anything, I’d see if you arrange your flights to stay a few days after your program ends. Find a hostel or cheap AirBnB to stay a few extra days to explore the city with more time (particular daylight time).

edit: updated my egregiously wrong info on who designed Mt Auburn Cemetery-- this in no way reduces its merits, though >_<"
Tufts,"Congrats. I'll go through the issues one by one.

(a) Harvard is a nice campus worth visiting, and close to places like Brattle St. and Porter Square that are interesting. Honestly, MIT is kind of a boring campus, but it doesn't hurt to visit just to say you did. The Common is nice, and you should definitely go visit the North End. There's a renowned Improv theatre there called Improv Asylum that's a nice event to do. 

(b) Amtrak is easily accessible, and shares stations with some of our subway lines (I use South Station). It's around 4 hours to NYC one-way. I think around $50? It's been a while since I looked. 

(c) It's a valid question, but you're going to be fine here. My family is Chilean and I've never had any issues here. Most of the racism I encountered in my life was in states outside of the Northeast. The racism here isn't nearly that blatant, and you probably won't be affected by structural issues since you're only here for a bit.

(d) I've literally never been invited to a college party so I have no idea. Just don't get wasted or anything, that's the easiest way to have problems with the cops. And for the love of god don't do any drugs here (except maybe weed). There's no point risking everything for a small high."
Tufts,"Congratulations. You're getting some great advice here, but I can offer one point about Newton. It's fairly large, and the different villages that make up that city are somewhat distinct. Areas north of I-90 (the east west interstate highway) are a little more dense, then to the south, where there are some *very* nice neighborhoods  - althoguh all the neighborhoods in Newton are certainly nice.

There is a bike path/walking path that runs along the Charles River, stretching into Newton and to Waltham. You can find it on pretty much any map.

Also, I wouldn't describe Newton as a typical American suburb. Massachusetts doesn't have many of the ""typical"" suburbs, to be honest, because it is so much older.

Congratulations on your week and a half at Tufts, you'll love it."
Tufts,you know it's a good post when it gets three automod responses right off the bat..
Tufts,"There’s been a bunch of info about train prices that don’t tell the whole story. 

If you can book a few weeks in advance, you can get the train (not the Acela) for as low as $29 each way. It won’t be the Acela (the fast train) at that price, but it’s still a very comfortable trip. Prices go up at the two week mark, but the cheap tickets can also sell out before then. The bus is still very likely to be cheaper, and I don’t know how tight your budget will be. I just didn’t want you to rule it out without knowing the possibility of getting seats at that price. There really isn’t a round trip discount, so train one way and bus the other is a possibility. 

I also don’t know whether you’d want to plan ahead that far in advance to get the cheapest pricing."
Tufts,"Hi there! Congratulations on getting into the program at Tufts!!! It's so cool to hear your excitement at coming to the city! You will be in Medford/ Somerville, as you know, but the area is really cool. You'll be close to Davis Square (I worked there for a long time) which has wonderful restaurants and shops. There is a lot to do and see there, and it is probably the closest t station to Tufts as well. Everything is super walkable. 
For the best views of Boston and Cambridge, rent a blue bike and ride along the bike paths that are on Memorial Drive (Cambridge side) and Storrow Drive (Boston side). They go along the Charles river and you can see the city skyline, and there are parks along the river, it's so nice.  The Fells are the closest trails to you, but definitely check out Blue Hills if you get the chance, and because I'm biased (I work in Jamaica Plain and live in Roslindale) I am going to recommend the Arnold Arboretum too.  It's not a forest, it's a reserve run by Harvard with trees and plants from around the world, and in April all the plants start waking up-- spring in the arboretum is so beautiful!! (It's very close to the Forest Hills t stop on the orange line too!)
The South End and Jamaica Plain are probably the best neighborhoods to look for queer nights at bars, but again that's just close to my part of Boston-- folks in Somerville will be able to tell you where to go around there.
Have so much fun!!!"
Tufts,"For Newton I suggest the following three mile walk. Framingham-Worcester commuter rail to West Newton. See the commercial crossroads there then walk uphill on Highland or Putnam streets. Right on temple, left on Prince Street. Follow that all the way out to Commonwealth Ave. Then Commonwealth east to Homer, which takes you past Newton’s ultra dignified City Hall and plush public library. Then right on Walnut St to Beacon St, Follow Beacon St east to Newton Centre, where you can have some refreshment, observe the pleasant shopping area there and board the T Riverside line back to Boston. This route takes you through some of the nicest, most upscale yet old suburban streets Newton has to offer."
Tufts,"If you're in Somerville there's really no reason to go anyplace else - other cities are disappointing in comparison. Welcome, we're glad to have you"
Tufts,If you going to pray I would recommend one God the only God ! And no you don’t have to worry about Race! Boston is the oldest big city in America and is multicultural!
Tufts,"Your not gonna be able to do much, for the week and a half you will be scheduled for most of your time and you will also be with a bunch of other kids doing the exact same thing. For security they are not just gonna let you go all over Boston. You will make friends and be more interested in hanging out with them then wandering around with no transportation. You'll see Tufts and some of Medford, maybe...the program may bring you to a few places around town but its very expensive to do that and why would they, Tufts is a big campus, they are not gonna do any touristy things."

Tufts,"Your post appears to be one of a number of commonly asked questions about the port city of Boston. Anyway, Royale is fine if you're just trying to get drunk and dance and hookup. The Grand is more of the same as Royale but more expensive and a stricter dress code.

Also, I can't believe I forgot this, but if you're into top 40 or hip hop, Venu, Cure, Icon, and Hava are places to go if you're looking for something a little nicer/fancier/more upscale than what the Faneuil Hall/Haymarket bars and clubs offer.

Tufts,Is Tufts providing the housing for you? Housing is tight and competitive.
Tufts,"Newton Highlands and walk the area around the lake. Also, you have to visit the best Dive Bar Around, one “DURTY NELLY’S”!!!"
Tufts,"Congratulations!

These may not be your thing, but the Maparium and the Christian Science Center, Harvard Museum of Natural History, Museum of Fine Arts, Museum of Science, Duck Boat tour, and aquarium are all fun. 

Congratulations and enjoy!

Definitely no worries about skin color, either."
Tufts,"Just wanted to say congratulations, you will fit in well here, my wife also comes from a very poor family in the Global South and she is making it work!"
Tufts,Just want to write congrats and I really hope that you will have a successful journey ahead of you.
Tufts,"if you are studying at Tufts in Medford, you will have much better access to Winchester, Lexington, and Arlington than Milton.  The cities/towns North of Boston also have a much better down-town area/homes and architecture, also better food."
Tufts,Arnold arboretum
Tufts,"Point c: as a brown person I've been harassed for being brown about once per year on average - more often when I was in my early 20s, less often now that I have gray hair. Generally it's just street harassment, where someone has yelled at me from like 10+ feet away to leave the country. I've never had to do anything other than ignore them. 

Since the symposium is a week and a half, are there sessions or other organized group activities you'll want to join in on the weekend? If you only have evenings, you're going to have a harder time fitting EVERYTHING in. If you have a full day available, you can probably plan a day to fit in i, ii, and iii if it's Mt Auburn Cemetery. To do that, I'd suggest: take the T to South Station, walk up the Rose Kennedy Greenway to the area around the aquarium, cut left into downtown along a reverse of the [walk to the sea](http://www.walktothesea.com/#) to get to the Boston Common. That would take maybe 2 hours, if you're taking the time to stop and gawp, and would cover ""downtown and the parks over the Big Dig."" Probably check out the Public Garden while you're there. Heck, you could even extend to heading down into Newbury St or to Copley. That takes care of (i). You then have many options to get to MIT. The Esplanade or Charles St to the Longfellow Bridge if you're still closer to the Public Garden/Common. Mass Ave bridge (measured by Smoots!) if you're as far west as Copley or thereabouts. From MIT you can either hop on the MBTA Rte 1 bus to get to Harvard or walk up Mass Ave. Since time is likely an issue, I'd recommend the bus - but if it's around a mealtime, it might not hurt to walk into Central Sq. You could then either take the bus or the red line to Harvard Sq. After you're done with checking out Harvard (and finished with (ii), you could walk along Brattle St to get to Mt Auburn Cemetery (iii). That part of Cambridge is going to feel a lot like some parts of Newton (iv - kind of). I don't think Newton or Milton are really the suburbs you're thinking of, though (as a long time consumer of American media, I feel like the closest you're going to get to portrayed suburbs might actually be some parts of Medford - the area right around Tufts, for instance.) I'm suggesting finishing the adventure in Mt Auburn Cemetery so you can use up as much time there as you have left, rather than starting there and running out of time for other things. I have no advice re: music venues or bars or parties because I'm a square. Sorry!

Amtrak is expensive and not very fast. Biden is famous for taking it because most people DON'T take it. You might be able to find fares that will be on par with coach bus fares (also leaving from South Station, in the bus terminal that isn't far from the Amtrak terminal.) But it's about 4 hours one-way (either by train or bus, though buses can take longer if there's traffic), so you're probably going to have to extend your trip or sacrifice your weekend to make it worthwhile. Or see if you can find a flight with an EXTENDED layover in NYC on your way to or From Boston? (I wouldn't leave the airport with anything less than 8 hours' layover, though) Or fly into/out of NY and take the train to/from BOS. That sounds like a terrific headache, though. And I've done a BUNCH of needlessly complicated trips to save money, so that's saying something."
Tufts,"It is so refreshing to read a post like this, a lot of us in this corner of the world can be so jaded. Your enthusiasm and excitement are really coming through. Congratulations on getting into your program and I hope you enjoy Boston. Please do visit NYC, it’s awesome here :)"
Tufts,"It'll be hard to fit in NYC unless you're adding more time outside of the program. That said, you could try to arrange to fly in/out of NYC and take Amtrak to/from Boston on your way in or out of the US. It's a scenic ride. That way you don't have to add a round trip to NYC in the middle of your visit. Note that Amtrak can cost $100+ each way on top of your flights.

You can technically ride Amtrak for free between Back Bay and South Station (it's like a 5 minute ride, you won't see much but you can say you did it, lol). 

Like some others have said, the suburbs you mentioned might not be the best use of your time. You can get some of the same vibe walking parts of Cambridge like Avon Hill or Mt Auburn Street (between Harvard and the cemetery). The yards aren't suburban big but it's very residential and New Englandy. 

Edit: forgot you'd be around Medford, you might find that area will also satisfy your ""suburbs"" itch as it's still pretty distinct from ""downtown"""
Tufts,"If you'll be here on Marathon Monday (April 18), you should definitely go to the Boston Marathon. It's the quintessential Boston event.

Tufts,"A lot of colleges have schedule and most colleges it increases your chances by an absolute fuck ton. I heard it'd be considered abnormal to be rejected from the school if you did fly in. I mean come on, they consider you good enough to fucking fly you in and you dont pay a cent. They clearly love you enough.

On Tuft's website it says you attend lectures, eat in dining halls, stay in dorms and watch student performances, which is pretty much the same thing other schools do"
Tufts,"Hey! I did Voices (for engineering) :) I really enjoyed my experience, and it definitely helped me get a sense of the school's culture and encourage me to apply. Their website can help you answer a lot of your questions, [especially the schedule](http://admissions.tufts.edu/voices/voices-home/voices-faq/). I don't know the acceptance rate, but I do know that people who attend Voices have a significantly higher acceptance rate (~50%). You also get a fee waiver for your application, which is nice"
Tufts,[deleted]
Tufts,"I parked on Boston ave for most of my soph year. There's street sweeping once a week for 6 months of the year on Tuesdays or Mondays depending on the side of the street, so you'll have to take pictures of the signs and remind yourself if you don't want to get towed. 
Also, if you park to close to the opening of a driveway or fire hydrant or bus stop, you'll get towed. 
You can park on Packard during the day and Friday and Saturday (and holiday) nights for free but a lot of commuters do that, so you'll be looking for a spot if you try to park there between 9am and 5pm.
I would also subscribe to city alerts on the medford website so you can get an email when they call a snow emergency, which means all cars on Boston Ave have to move or get towed.

I'll also dm you some details"
Tufts,"You honestly don't need a car. Between the joey and the T, the cost of the two or three tickets you will likely get doesn't outweigh the convenience of grabbing a Lyft or the occasional zip car when needed. Everything is within walking distance. If you want to go longer distances just use a zip car."
Tufts,super chill school - culture isn’t toxically competitive
Tufts,I disagree with the statement that its hard to go into Boston. I think its suuuuper easy. I go into Boston very frequently.
Tufts,"For Why Tufts, I reccomend looking at the programs available and comparing them to your interests. If you see something you like, mention it in the essay. Other than that, ask yourself why you would go to Tufts is it quirky? Did you like the people you met there? Do you like the location and size of the school? 

For pros and cons, pro is that its a great school with a lot of different types of people. When I came to Tufts, I almost had this image in my mind of the type of personality that a Tufts student has, and I expected that most people were at least kind of like that. However, there are so many different types of people. People with different personalities, different backgrounds, different experiences. 

One big con for a lot of people is definitely the 6 semester language requirement. Also, most of the people I know don't really leave campus that often. Even though Tufts is close to Boston, it's not really close enough to explore Boston unless you go out of your way. That will probably change with the new T station which was supposed to open next year."
Tufts,"I connected each hobby/interest of mine with a part of Tufts that would help me grow + feel at home. Come for the great people, random intl. politics conversations in dorm bathrooms and decent enough proximity to Boston."
Tufts,"Hello, you are receiving this message because based on what you wrote automod thinks you are asking about getting to the airport. If that is not the case, just stop reading. But if it is the case, then we are here to get you sorted. There is a lot of confusion and fear right now, and frankly some ~~filthy transplants~~ people seem to be unaware of the various tunnels that go to East Boston. So let us tell you about them. First there is the Ted Williams Tunnel. Named for the Red Sox Hall of Fame legend who was the greatest hitter ever, and who was also a WWII and Korean War vet. This tunnel is on the Mass Pike and goes from South Boston to East Boston. If you are going to the fucking aiport from the West or from the South, you will be using this tunnel. That means that the Sumner Tunnel closure will have no fucking impact on your fucking trip. With me so far? 
Lets get to the next tunnel the Callahan Tunnel. This tunnel runs from the North End to East Boston. It was named for Lt. William F. Callahan, Jr who died in WWII. This fucking tunnel takes you from the North End to East Boston. You might fucking use this to get to the fucking airport if you are traveling from Northwest of the city. Now read that last sentence again, cause it is fucking important. This tunnel takes you to the fucking airport. If you are coming from North of the city, like say Saugus, or Lynn, you are using 1A, and not even dealing with a fucking tunnel. Now then, let us bring it on home with the last tunnel, the Sumner Tunnel. The Sumner Tunnel is named for William Hyslop Sumner. This tunnel takes you from East Boston to the North End. This is the tunnel you might use if you are leaving the airport and headed Northwest, or are commuting into the city from the Northwest. It is NOT the tunnel that you use to get to the airport.

Tufts,"Public transit is very easy, but it’s not necessarily convenient. You may end up waiting a while for trains depending on the time of day. But if you have time/energy and want to save money, you can take the airport shuttle to the blue line and transfer to the red line to wherever you’re headed. Public transit is always good for people-watching and getting a sense of the local culture. But if your work is paying, take a cab!
If you have time during the work week, definitely check out Somerville and Cambridge in the evenings for food, nightlife, and strolling around. For your off days it might be fun to go into downtown Boston, walk along the Charles River, do some sightseeing around the harbor. It’s a bit far from Medford but I always recommend the Arnold Arboretum in Jamaica Plain/Roslindale."
Tufts,"I live in Medford so if you are looking for some stuff in Medford I suggest the following:

Deep Cuts Deli recently opened which is a music venue, bar and sandwich shop. They have a couple shows a week usually. 

Real Gusto is an Italian restaurant and the owners are from Italy. Really good pasta and pizza. 

For Pizza is another good pizza spot. They serve South Shore Bar style Pizza which is from South Shore Boston 

Tenoch is a good Mexican spot, especially the Tortas. The same owners are opening a tequila bar called Tacuba which has been in the works for years but they said should be opening soon. 

Goldilox is a good bagel place open on Friday, Saturday and Sunday mornings. I usually get a bacon egg and cheese on an everything bagel with hot sauce. 

Collette is a French bakery and the owners are from France. Everything is good there. 

Tamper is a coffee shop very close to Tufts that is pretty good. 

Tasty Cafe is a good breakfast spot near tufts. I really like the Chicken and Waffles. 

I also like Kushari and Grill near tufts for Egyptian. 

Bob’s Italian Food for sandwiches, they have a great Italian sandwich. 

Tufts is also not far from Davis Square which has great stuff as well."
Tufts,Go up to Montréal and make fun of the Québécois.

Tufts,"If your work is at Tufts they have a beautiful view of downtown from the top of the library! 

Boston is a very walkable city and, in my opinion, the best way to explore. The North End is a very cool neighborhood to walk around in. Many fantastic restaurants, bars, and bakeries. You could participate in the Mike’s/Modern/Bova cannoli debate if you enjoy pastries. Neptune Oyster is one of my favorite spots if the wait isn’t long (week day). 

Bacon Hill is also a great neighborhood to wonder around in, some very cool streets and pubs to stop into.

Santé!"
Tufts,"1. Most people take uber or lyft instead of taxis.
2. You can get around the city by the train (we call it ""the T""), but don't rely on it if you need to be anywhere at a certain time. You can get to Medford by train and bus for sure.
3. The city has lost a lot of its soul the past decade. In its place is ""Guy Fieries Taco Bites"" and ""Cheeky monkey brew / barcade."" Basically, corporate restaurant groups are killing out small businesses. 
4. That said, the North End is worth a visit (even if one family owns a majority of it). Cafe Victoria, Stanza Sigari, Aqua Pazza, Regina Pizzeria, Bova's Bakery, ect. are solid spots.
5. Harvard and/or Central Square are worth visiting (in Cambridge the town on the other side of the Charles)
6. Becon Hill is kind of cool. Fenway Park is great (but drink before you go in). Near Fenway you have the MFA and Elizabeth Gartner Mueseams, which are  always cool to see."
Tufts,"You can get a 7 day T pass from the MBTA and it's $22.50 for unlimited rides. Otherwise it's $2.40 per ride. You can just do one ride from the airport, blue line shuttle to the blue line then pay your $2.40 and then it's a free transfer at Government center to the green line to get to Tufts. If you want to do stuff in Boston like the MFA, then you can use the weekly pass to get around. Of course there's always Uber and Lyft too, but I hear they occasionally cancel and you get stuck waiting for another one. Mind as well just wait for the T. In addition to the Harvard museum of art which is free, there's also the Harvard Museum of Natural history which is not free, but both accessible by T. There's also Institute of Contemporary Art which is free Thursday nights from 5-9pm but you should reserve tickets the day of. The Mapparium is also interesting. 

https://www.mbta.com/fares"
Tufts,"Biking in Boston is super dangerous, and Boston drivers are murderous assholes.  That said Blue Bikes, our bikeshare program, are a super convenient (necessary?) way to fill in the gaps of the crumbling transit system, and a good way to see the city if it doesn't kill you.  Boston's also super nice for walking.  Get out at North Station, go to Bova's for canolli, check out the Fanuel Hall slave market (don't buy anything; go to Public Market if you're hungry) and make you're way to Acorn Street for the Gram, at which point, one could hit a dispensary and/or packie (liquor store -- just remember to drink discreetly in public here) and head down to the river.

If you're into international cuisine, definitely eat all the Mexican, Dominican, and Brazilian food everywhere around where you're staying.  More in surrounding towns but Everett, Chelsea, Revere, Somerville all have a lot of really good restaurants run by recent and not so recent immigrants from Latin America that are probably better than what you're gonna find in France.  We have great Lebanese restaurants too, but you can get that at home.  Unfortunately, you'll have to bike or figure out buses (the consensus on this sub seems to be that the Transit app is the best for that), because Boston lacks good transit between outlying areas without going back into the hub.  There's Haitian places in Somerville and Cambridge that might be fun for a Francophone too.  

Harvard art museum is free, the other museums in the city probably have passes you might be able to get from the library at Tufts.  Definitely check out the Arboretum too.  It's not the Tuileries, but it's not exactly a strictly utilitarian botanical garden either."
Tufts,"Bienvenue ! I recommend a taxi. If traffic is heavy, then I would consider public transit if it cuts down on travel time. You should try to see a Red Sox game, walk the Freedom Trail (you’ll see the major sites), go to Boston public garden, eat seafood."
Tufts,"One of the airport tunnels is closed so it’s best to take public transportation out of the airport, then get an Uber 

Depending on the location of your hotel, you could:
-take the silver line to South Station, then the red line to Davis Square or
-Take the blue line to State and then take the orange line to Wellington 
And pick up an Uber from there.

Whenever I bring gifts to France, I like to go to a store called Old Navy & buy t-shirts or tote bags with American flags on them. There is one located on the Downtown Crossing stop on orange or red line train.

Also when I’m downtown, I check out the Army Navy store for flag stickers or magnets.

There’s other tourist shops downtown that I like to grab stickers/ magnets that say Boston & have lobsters on them 🦞

I also like to bring Boston Red Sox gear (our Major League Baseball team). I usually find towels, t shirts, sometimes hats at the Marshall’s & TJ Maxx stores at Downtown Crossing.

In terms of activities for yourself, what do you like to do at home?"
Tufts,"Without knowing exactly where you're hostel is, Tufts is very accessible by public transportation (green like, and to some degree maybe the red line depending on where you will be). The only payment is that our system right now is underground a lot of maintenance, because it is old. It has required trains to make less trips, speed restrictions, and sometimes even transfers to bus. It's all feasible, but will depend on your timing. If you are traveling for work, definitely opt for a cab or Uber to keep it easy.

As to a recommendation for a take home momento, what do you like? Food? Something to remind you of the city? Clothes?"
Tufts,"Yes, public transportation will be significantly cheaper. I've never gone from airport to Medford, so I don't have a good read on that. It does seem high, but don't take my word for it.  The ride itself should not be a long ride, unless you are flying in during peak commuting times. Then it might be a long journey due to traffic jams. That's the bad part of having an airport close to the heart of the city.

For food.. Most iconic Boston foods aren't the most transportable (seafood), unless you look for something a little kitschy like Fluff (spreadable marshmallow) or Lobster shaped candy or treats. I can't say we make any stellar wines, but we do have a number of popular local breweries. Sam Adams is the big local brand sold nationally, but there are a number of microbreweries. I don't drink, so I'll leave it to others who might be able to recommend ones they like. Some do sell cans of their own beer.  This link might help in the meantime.

Tufts,If you are into music / Jazz check out Wally’s. Great spot.
Tufts,"On the question of what to bring home, I would go to Colette Bakery and talk to the owner. She can probably give you some great ideas for gifts that your people will appreciate."
Tufts,"I used to live right by Tufts and have taken a cab from the airport back to my place. Took around 20ish minutes and was $25 with tip. Bonus was that there is usually at least 1-3 cab waiting in the taxi line while if you go with rideshare you have to wait. Just make sure the taxi guy starts the meter and doesn’t offer you a flat fee, always take the meter.

A bunch of good food reccs have been made but if you are looking for good italien subs check out Bobs Italien. It’s so worth the money and I would get 2 extra meals because they give you so much food."
Tufts,we have ice cubes
Tufts,"Definitely hang out in Davis Square as one of the city's best squares for bar hopping/casual dining.

Dragon Pizza is the best pizza in New England.

If you're a movie buff, Somerville Theater is one of the premier theaters in the US - it's a national treasure.

Saloon is a great Cocktail bar.

The Goods is a great cannabis dispensary.

Red Bones is coming back as a solid American BBQ spot.

Waikiki has amazing pokebowls, fresh teas, and smoothies.

FoodDy's Kitchen as the best fried chicken sandwich in all of Boston.

Angelina's Pizzeria is a classic slice/subs shop and easily one of the best super casual spots in all of Boston.


Another spot near Tufts - Collette in Medford is a French baakry owned and operated by a French woman. You can expect normal French cafe food and you can order in French!

Semolina is one Tufts campus and a delicious spot for homemade pasta meals and great sandwiches."
Tufts,If you are going to be at Tufts in Medford. Avoid Boston. Go to Cambridge or Somerville. The Green line is Hell.
Tufts,"I think the main point is Medford ≠ Boston. You will be close, but you will not be in Boston."
Tufts,"If you have a few extra days, please get outside of Boston and experience New England.  

Take a day trip to Providence if you can only use public transit - it's a great small city to explore. Could even take a bus to Newport for the day and explore.

The beaches in southern Rhode Island are sublime (East Beach, Charlestown is one of the best in all of New England). Well worth the trip and spend the day at a beach.

Tufts,Go to the cheers bar
Tufts,Medford is NOT Boston.
Tufts,"Come gather round, ye sailors bold,
Ill tell a tale of tunnels old.
Of Boston town and its grand design,
A passage neath the waters fine.

Oh, hoist the sails and set them high,
We'll sing a song as the waves go by.
Through Sumner Tunnel we shall steer,
Onward to the city, loud and clear.

In days of old, a vision grand,
To link the shores, by sea and land.
Engineers and workers strong,
Built a tunnel 'gainst currents thronged.

Oh, hoist the sails and set them high,
We'll sing a song as the waves go by.
Through Sumner Tunnel we shall steer,
Onward to the city, loud and clear.

With grit and sweat, they carved the way,
Beneath the waves, come what may.
Through rock and clay, they toiled deep,
To pave a path for all to keep.

Oh, hoist the sails and set them high,
We'll sing a song as the waves go by.
Through Sumner Tunnel we shall steer,
Onward to the city, loud and clear.

Now cars and trucks, they pass on through,
In this artery of concrete true.
From East Boston to the city's core,
A lifeline strong forevermore.

Oh, hoist the sails and set them high,
We'll sing a song as the waves go by.
Through Sumner Tunnel we shall steer,
Onward to the city, loud and clear.

So raise a glass to those who dared,
To dream a passage, so well prepared.
The Sumner Tunnel, a maritime feat,
Connecting lands, where sailors meet.

Oh, hoist the sails and set them high,
We'll sing a song as the waves go by.
Through Sumner Tunnel we shall steer,
Onward to the city, loud and clear.

So when you traverse this tunnel deep,
Remember the labor, the promises to keep.
For the Sumner Tunnel binds us all,
From harbor's edge to city's call.

Tufts,"Boston probably has one of the best public transportation systems in the country. Tufts is on the green line now, so it shouldn’t be too much of a hassle. As for what to do there, what sorta things do you like to do?"
Tufts,"Tufts Medford campus is really nice, don’t forget to take a walk around it. They have a downtown campus in China town that you can also explore  while enjoying some descent Chinese food."
