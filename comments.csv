College,Comment
ASU,"this is no different from every other $25 lyft coupon available, only you make money instead of my friends who have $25 codes. "
ASU,">Remember look for the cars with the pink mustaches. 

Actually drivers have been instructed not to put them on their vehicles since the mustaches make them targets for enforcement in Arizona. Uber > Lyft anyways"
ASU,Why is it every time I get a lyft they give me codes for free rides but these codes can only be used by someone who has never had a lyft? Obviously I won't be able to use it.
ASU,Lyft always been cheaper for me
ASU,"I'm not a huge fan of Uber as a business so I default to Lyft. If lyft is too expensive or gonna take too long, then I'll see what Uber can do, but it's rare they can do better."
ASU,"I have found Lyft to better for short distances, like within a 10-15 min drive and Uber for longer distances."
ASU,"I use both and use whoever is cheaper at the time. Surprisingly Uber has saved me a couple extra bucks compared to Lyft. 
For the airport though I still use the lightrail"
ASU,"If it's peak times and you need a ride to/from airport, neither. Call a real cab company like Yellow or Discount (or look for the airport line) and avoid the surge pricing. Taxi from airport to Tempe is about $15 and no surge premiums."
ASU,"LSA is pretty smack dab in the middle of campus so it depends on how far you want to walk/inconvenience your driver. Getting dropped off in the parking lot for First United Methodist Church on University is probably the easiest and it's a 5 minute walk to LSA. if you're coming from North/Northwest/West then I'd do that. 

If you're coming from South/Southeast/East then I would have them drop you off at ISTB/Campus bookstore. Which is about a 5 minute walk to LSA as well. Traffic can be balls on Orange St. however, especially during midday. Lots of cars and pedestrians.

Getting dropped off by WP Carey building on Lemon could also work. Bit longer walk and traffic will still be balls, but that's Tempe campus in a nutshell. 

Someone else will hopefully come in with a great tip."
ASU,Lyft and Uber will prompt you to select a drop off spot on campus. My advice is to just focus on getting on to campus and use google maps to walk to class.
ASU,Congrats bro. I’m happy for anyone that gets their degree and reaches for higher education. I couldn’t imagine driving Uber and going to school full time. I was lucky enough that I worked in hotels overnight so I just did all my homework while I “worked”. No better felling than going to school for the last time. Proud of you.
ASU,Congratulations on your hard work. On the road and in school. Hope ypu can work at Uber HQ and fix things you feel are not working right for drivers AND riders. 🎉🎊👍👨‍🎓👩‍🎓
ASU,"Great job, congratulations. I took advantage of it as well, I have 1 semester and I’ll graduate with a software engineering degree. The total cost was almost $100K. I paid less than $500 for books and other miscellaneous. 

Drivers if you can take advantage of this program."
ASU,"Congrats! You should point out that Uber will cover the ASU bill for the driver OR an immediate family member. My wife has been working on turning her Registered Nurse (RN with an Associates Degree) into a Bachelors of Science in Nursing @ ASU online for almost two years now, and she’s only got one more semester to go! Never paid a penny in tuition, only books. It’s a good deal!"
ASU,Congrats! Agree that don’t fully rely on rideshare for living. Most ppl won’t make it.
ASU,Congratulations! It's nice to hear a success story with Uber's corporate name attached to it once in a while. I'm happy you recognized your own hard work here too though. Best of luck in the future.
ASU,How many rides a week is that to maintain status?
ASU,Context? What is ASU and what is the special deal they have with Uber?
ASU,How long did it take for you to achieve 3000 lifetime rides?
ASU,I thought I declined a lot of rides. 20% AR? What kind of rides are you even fishing for?
ASU,I believe that Uber expanded the program to cover masters degrees on Jan 1st. I’d call ASU on Tuesday to confirm though.
ASU,"There are requirements you need to meet to get through admissions. If your grades sucked in highschool then you won't make it in

however.

they have a program to help you increase your gpa. the classes are free but the final grade costs a few hundred bucks. its worth it in the long run considering uber is willing to pay thousands and thousands per semester for you.

here's a list for first year students: https://asuonline.asu.edu/admission/first-year/apply/

heres one for transfer students that have gone to college before in the past: https://asuonline.asu.edu/admission/transfer/apply/"
ASU,"It's not ""free"". You'll have to become a slave to uber and take every single trip they give you at ridiculous rates.  

Then they'll pay after your get whatever financial aid you get. Then you have to continuously requalify or lose the benefit."
UF,"So when in the proper zone, is it best to Lyft instead of snap? Snap instead of Lift?"
UF,"Its 50% off between those hours but they also give u some free rides! Every year I think I get 5 free rides, it’s so awesome. Sometimes tho it gets really busy and u have to take an uber or wait super long"
UF,"I’m shocked so many people don’t know about the UF Lyft pass. My friends constantly complain about how expensive Uber is and REFUSE to download Lyft even though I keep telling them about it! 

Anywhere on campus for like a dollar or two. It’s awesome!"
UF,"Just a warning to others - I tried to use this last Friday night around 10:30 and Lyft couldn't find a driver (tried twice over 40 mins, just ended up paying full price for an Uber before it got even later) so be sure to have a backup plan!!"
UF,I have 15$ lyft passes for 5$ dm me
UF,"A really cool partnership between UF and Lyft! See below:

https://taps.ufl.edu/alternative-transportation/uf-safe-rides/"
UF,for abt a month or so lyft + UF gave me like 25% off all my rides that fell into this like “boundary circle” and it was very helpful considering i used to not go far. maybe they’re offering it again?
UF,Its the n-word pass when using Lyft.
UF,"Haven’t used Lyft but assuming it has similar safety measures to Uber, you should be able to share your location with family/friends and/or reach out to a safety line or 911 if needed. Plus their background checks are pretty stringent so far as I know. I’d just make sure to schedule the ride ahead of time if possible and be prepared for a pretty expensive fare since that’s prob going to be over $100+tip lol"
UF,That’s an 1 1/2-2 hr ride from Jax to campus. Try red coach or some bus service
UF,"Me and my family used lyft fairly frequently around gainesville and often ran into the same couple of drivers. there were only two times i felt uncomfortable, but i wasn't alone both times and those were two drivers we'd never seen before."
UF,Are these Lyft safe rides free for those hours?
UF,"Obviously scooter and driving in a car are different than literally paying for Uber to get to and from class, and this post is a friendly PSA — but, just try out the bus if you don’t rely on it already. They’re fairly routine in their stops, they get you from point A to point B, you can read a book or watch TikTok while you’re on the move, and you don’t have to drive — and if your stop is a few blocks away from your destination you even get some exercise in. 

I definitely could have physically afforded to pay for Ubers to and from class and not been *completely* broke at UF (I’m a very recent grad) — but that’s just utterly wasted money if you live anywhere around campus in the usual student housing complexes. And, the vast majority of people (myself included) cannot even imagine justifying relying on ride share services to get to class regularly because of $$$. I’m surprised that’s a thing. Obviously if it’s an emergency, yeah. But are students relying on Lyft so much they need a reminder to like, find any other non-$20 way to get to campus?

If so, UF needs to pump more money into RTS"
UF,"It’s Hitch and if  anyone wants to help a homie out and use my referral link because I’m broke here it is :D 

https://www.ridehitch.com/r/CVIhbsJbKJ"
UF,"I used it for GNV -> JAX the other day and it was pr smooth, similar experience to Uber

It doesn’t let you drop the pin in an exact location tho, so if you’re trying to get picked up from an apartment community call your driver and tell them where you are"
UF,Use whatever one is cheaper and you're good to go. I compare prices on the Google maps tab for ride-sharing
UF,"I always prefer Lyft, it tends to be slightly cheaper, granted I don't use rideshare often. I've never had any issues with either though."
UF,"if you care about political stuff, some people have been boycotting uber due to some scandals in recent years. this is of course a personal decision and does not affect the system whatsoever, but it's something to think about. ([\#deleteuber 2017](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/02/why-deleteuber-and-other-boycotts-matter/517416/), [boycott uber 2019](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boycott-uber-2019-faces-boycott-threats-after-ceo-calls-jamal-khashoggis-murder-a-mistake/))

i've only had good experiences with uber, been using it for 2 years now. i haven't had to pay more than $8 for rides on uber, but then again i tend to use it on sat & sun mornings when it is less busy.  i can't speak for lyft because i simply can't be bothered to download a second rideshare app lol. but these drivers know they're in a college town and are usually pretty friendly. :)

edit: formatting & links"
UF,"Free bus rides; free newspaper subscriptions like the NYT; private access to Lake Wauburg with free kayak and canoe rentals; free access to the entire UF library database which includes scholarly journals, historical records both physical and digital, and all types of film; etc. There’s likely more but that’s what I’ve taken advantage of in my time here."
UF,50% off lyft ride from 9pm - 3 am most days of the week. U should get an email soon with the link
UCLA,"Can you imagine it would be annoying and time consuming to drive through campus? Because if so, that may be the reason. 

The area I drive in has a few colleges and some of the campuses are really annoying and time consuming. Like it may take me 10 minutes to drive through with all the speed bumps and stop signs. That’s -0 minutes I could do 1-2 complete rides instead."
UCLA,"Where I am there is only two colleges, one is pretty open and there’s not a huge issue but ones gated and hard to get around so doing ride share is a nightmare. I have more of an. Issue with military bases and people not realizing I can’t pick them up or drop off there (with once exception where I got a contractors badge)."
UCLA,"Walk off campus into Westwood.  If possible, take a bus for a bit closer to your destination, and then get an Uber/Lyft from there."
UCLA,"“ There was wide variation in what percent the company took of the passenger fare. In February 2019, the company took 30% or more of the fare on about 9% of the rides. In April 2022, the company took a 30% or more cut of the passenger fare for 29% of all rides.”

&#x200B;

interesting little stat, the last one!

The implication is that 70% of rides (in that Month), uber took less than 30% of the “fare”.

of course, between the 2019 and 2022, the business model changed (given the introduction of guarantees) Justifying some change to funds collection."
UCLA,"Basically, rather than walk across campus, they just call an Uber or Lyft to get dropped off at their next class. And it's cheap enough that this is a common thing."
UCLA,"Students used to pay me 3 bucks per uber trip to drive them 3 buildings down the road. But that'd take 15min to do. So I ended up pretty much working at minimum wage. The worst of em would want me to cart them and 4+ of their friends. Sorry man, you need an Uber XL. So then I get shit over not accommodating them. 

The worst was after the bars let out and they all wanted rides a few blocks back to the fraternity houses/dorms. The worst. 

Hated ubering at Tulane/Loyala. Most pretentious people I ever met."
UCLA,"They should ban Uber and lyft on campus. Make those fuckers walk, bike, or skate."
UCLA,"Why walk 15 minutes in nice warm weather? Wait 13 on your ass then take a 2 minute car ride using Papa's credit card. It's all part of the social media curse. I actually know a kid that commit suicide because his uber rating dropped so low drivers wouldn't pick him up. He would use it to literally go 3-5 mins of distance 2 plus times a day, so a few blocks."
UCLA,"yeah this happens a lot at peak hours when everyone’s trying to get a rideshare. i often just select “wait and save” and do homework in my room or play videogames until it says they’re close. usually works for me although it can take a bit. usually if you wait until 6 or 7, getting one is a lot easier too"
UCLA,Yup it’s super common fuck Uber and Lyft
UCLA,"I always used the Gateway plaza location, because it's the one easiest to find for Uber/Lyft drivers not familiar with campus. If you're close enough, it's a great pick-up location."
UCLA,"My Lyft drivers just meet me where I ask for a pickup. The designated locations are intended to improve the flow of traffic. 

Good intentions, but a hopelessly ineffective solution. "
UCLA,Pick up at sunset canyon is actually ridiculous. It's a single lane with no where to pull over. It's actually really dangerous since cars have to go in opposing traffic to get past if drivers just stop there
UCLA,"Uber has its own designated locations around UCLA. For instance, Dickson court is the usual pickup spot for north campus and has its own option. You can always select specific roads if you want for places such as the dorms. Shouldn’t be a problem. "
UCLA,"Whenever I've used them, the driver picks me up a little bit further away. Idk if this is because it's difficult for them to get to the location, or another reason."
UCLA,"I take the bruinbus to campus. Only really use lyft in the rare occasion I need to get home quick. 

>The report may also point up the conflicted attitudes of a younger generation that has become somewhat dubious about the automobile because of its damaging impact on the environment and urban traffic, and yet has also embraced ride-hailing as a quick and inexpensive way of getting around.

I work for lyft during the vacations and have done around 900 rides, not alot but certainly enough to get a feel for who takes lyft. out of 20-30 rides I will get people ages 18-29 sure, but I see older folks and senior citizens all the time. Everyone uses rideshare apps fuck off. 

Also, the larger problem with Los Angeles if you are referring to smog and traffic related issues is your goddamn horrid transportation system. It's impossible to get anywhere in Los Angeles without a car. From UCLA, to La Boom in huntington park took almost 5 hours via bus and multiple times I had to get off and then walk maybe half a mile just to fucking transfer. I made the same trip, picked up a friend, got food, and got there in around 2 hours when I drove my car. 

How about you improve your transportation system, build more metro stations, bus routes, and other forms of more efficient transportation before you blame students waking up late and needing to get to class on time. "
UCLA,"I have taken many a $3 trip from my apt to my job on north campus. It’s just so freakin hilly and basically a workout for me to get there. But I would absolutely stop if there was a bus that could take me there. I really just want a stop on Gayley or Strathmore that goes to Wyton Circle. UCLA just has to spend money on other frivolous things. 

Also I hope I’m not being discriminatory or anything but a lot of my international friends only take Ubers to get to campus, like it’s a regular everyday thing for them."
UCLA,"No, and you can blame California's new legislation that essentially kills the gig economy for that.  Uber has already gotten rid of their upfront pricing scheme (except for pooling), and Lyft will no longer have the $5.49 promotion. 

 It was already costly for Lyft before (they were fine burning money for increased market share) but now it's entirely cost prohibitive.  It's not coming back."
UCLA,Damn.. I love doing Lyft at UCLA on Friday and Saturday nights... it is non-stop stacked up rides. Someone’s always got to screw up a good thing.
UCLA,"I smell upcoming tax and forced extortion sessions upcoming. Quick, campus police transportation enforcement division will be pounding the pavement hard armed with fully-outfitted enforcement vehicles and high-volume digital ticketbooks, ready to enforce the newly minted and ""highly demanded"" rideshare taxes. That'll be $200 for loitering over 2 minutes. That'll be a $400 tow for not displaying ride share trade dress on campus. Empires always have to exploit and extort their neighbors and peasants. "
USC,"shryft is the essentially the same process as fryft, only now being that the rides you book will most likely be shared w another person- usc student or not. fryft was nice bc you could have a whole car to yourself, and basically 2-3 of your friends could ride along. now you can only have 1 other person. i was a first year fall 2021 and had only known fryft, but it was changed (back) to shryft spring 2023 (most likely bc covid policies were starting to loosen up, and fryft probably costs usc a ton more money). shryft was horrible in the beginning though, bc waiting for one could literally take hours, compared to minutes w fryft. i definitely think the system is better now though, since i haven’t had to wait nearly as long towards the end of the semester. once you book a ride, you’re automatically either put in a car w 1-2 others, or you may have the car to yourself, or pick up another person. it works 7 days a week 6pm-2am, but home fb games and other coliseum events affect that. hope this helps!"
USC,"People are being dramatic. I’ve never once been in a shryft with a non-usc student, and although sometimes they can take a while and being inconvenient, they are SO SO SO SO MUCH SAFER than walking alone through south central at night. Saves you a ton of money too."
USC,Shryft is much less safe and anxiety-free bc ur with a random person and possibly not sober. It also takes years to get a ride and lies about how soon it'll be
USC,I got the email invitation for this rideshare. But I’m still confused. Do we have to live on campus or what is the mile radius we can be from campus and still be order a ride?
USC,I stopped using the program once they switched over to shryft
USC,"Yes, USC still does the share rides for the students with that schedule. But is it summer and There is literally very few students there. It’s a ghost town. There’s a bunch of drivers parked, waiting for pings and nothing."
USC,"Shared still exists? I disabled those requests nearly a year ago and also haven't had to deal with switches and auto-queue bullshit for a couple months by now. Drivers, update your settings."
USC,I don’t think they’re receiving free share rides during summer. I tried doing this promotion and I wasn’t receiving anything. I was there for nearly 25 mins and nothing. I could be wrong though.
USC,"i believe they still do the ride program but it's just regular solo rides, not shared rides"
USC,Was there like 2 weeks ago and I got nothing. Way too many drivers sitting there even during the summer. I swear about 100 lyft drivers alone were camping it was insane I left after 30 mins driving around with no pings.
USC,"1. You can get tons of rides — it seems like they group them 2 or 3 pickups at a time, so when you finally get a ping you're making at least 2 stops. I hit 26 rides one night when I was trying to get the signup bonus. 

2. You won't make a lot of money — unless it's surging and/or a power zone, you're making little money. It's best for bonus hitting missions.

3. Your rating goes down — for whatever reason USC rides ding your rating. I'm at 5 stars after 566 rides so I know I'm doing something right, but consistently I get dinged on campus rides. It's the only place in LA where this happens. I'm not sure if students are high maintenance, or if their interface defaults at 4 stars?

4. Its crowded — anytime it's surging, the area is packed to the gills with drivers. During major surges I've sat for an hour without any hits. I've ended up walking around Trader Joes with the app on just waiting for a hit. "
USC,Interesting timing... UCLA just rolled out a $5.99 flat rate program with Uber for any rides within 5 miles of campus. 
USC,I had one week where I was aiming for PDB and ended up giving a bunch of rides for USC students and I believe that's when my rating went from 4.92 to a 4.72.. I don't know if it has to do with that program but I've avoided those rides and just don't accept Line rides from there ever.
USC,"Advantages:

Ddoing Lyft at USC is only good when working on a promotion. You usually get back to back rides around usc. The most I've done in a day was 30 rides. So if I can do so can you. Then again, students start using the Lyft app from 7pm to 2am. So it's better to get there around 630pm to be ready for rides.

Disadvantages:

You'll see a lot of lyft drivers with their emblem on during night time. So it'll take a while 2 get rides. But once you get a ride, you will get multiple rides since students only use lyft pool. Also, the pay is not good. There would be times where I pick up 3 students and get paid $2.62 or around $4.

Ps. When driving around usc...be careful lol lots of students are on their bikes and they pop out of nowhere!!!!!!"
USC,"This all happened to me too,  but how does the lyft driver exactly tip himself using the screen thing? This is the first I heard of this screen thing but I guess it happened to me too, because I never clicked the button and I thoguht it was some bug in the app. I tried contacting lyft but they never got back to me."
USC,"I just checked all my lyfts from this weekend because of this post, happened to me too. With Edgar in a Toyota Corolla"
USC,"I’ve been noticing 1-2 unexpected tipping charges a month recently. I always assumed it was me being clumsy and hitting it accidentally, but I’ve also begun suspecting the screens. Sometimes the driver doesn’t have one in the backseat, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t keeping it up front and tipping themselves afterwards.

I can’t find any way to contact Lyft support. I go to report a “billing issue” or whatever, and they run some automated check on my recent rides and tell me everything looks okay and I can’t dispute anything. You could file a dispute with your credit card company, but that probably means having your account deactivated."
USC,"If anyone else has experienced this issue, I would recommend contacting their support on Twitter, @AskLyft. They’ve been pretty responsive for me so far. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the app, a driver scheme, or whatever else, but enough people need to contact support so that they realize it’s a recurring issue and not just people clicking the wrong button by mistake."
USC,"I just got a notification that I apparently tipped Hector $28 for a $24 ride! I usually tip $5, and definitely wouldn't have tipped that much."
USC,"To everyone who has noticed this happen, I strongly suggest you go into your Lyft app settings and double check if default tip is turned on, either at $5 or a percentage. If you contact Lyft support they will likely have you check this first so good to rule it out so you can say ""I already checked and default tip is turned off"". 

Lyft added this setting a while ago and you may not have noticed. It is currently only available for iOS users so people on Android might not see it in settings. 

More info: https://help.lyft.com/hc/e/all/articles/115013081368-How-to-tip-your-driver

Tagging /u/tw822 so they see this and maybe want to consider adding it to the text of their post just in case."
USC,"[Another Instance](https://www.reddit.com/r/USC/comments/xyxeu9/lyft_automatic_tips/) , where I faced the same fraud !"
USC,"This is happening to me too but when I contacted the Lyft customer support they said they cant help me if its a tip. Its frustrating talking to the Lyft customer support; the interface, the questions and the help, everything is shitty. I got frustrated at the whole situation, went through all five stages of grief and thought I made my peace until I saw this"
USC,This happened to me too. I was charged a $5 dollar tip 2 DAYS after I took a fryft (keep in mind it was one 0.2 miles away)
USC,"Well. If you file a complaint on the Lyft app, they will give you a 5 USD coupon in return. So, it balances out. They know that their drivers are expert scammers. So, in order to balance between reduction of driver numbers and customer dissatisfaction; they do this."
USC,"It isnt the screens, lyft is defaulting to a 5$ tip sometimes, and when we rate the driver we do not pay heed to this selection and complete the ride from our end. I got charged 5$ this way and realized it was my mistake. Idk why lyft suddenly started to default to 5$ randomly."
USC,OMG NO WAY THIS HAPPENED TO ME TWICE and i tried contacting lyft support but they said since it was a tip they couldnt help me!!! i thought ive just been careless but … holy shit cant believe its a legit thing people are doing
USC,"Mine were from dudes named Oscar and Derek, the Lyft app doesn’t have any option to dispute tips so I went to the safety section and filed it there. I was able to call a Lyft representative and she refunded me both of the tips that were taken from me so you guys should try that!"
USC,I had this happen too. Its lyft. They are adding $5.00 tips to their drivers with 5 stars but using the customers to pay it. I am reporting this to my cc company. It’s the principle. They decided now they will reward their 5 star drivers but they use the customer money for it. I dont care about being banned from them. Uber is better anyway. Dont authorize people money without permission.
USC,Don’t be an asshole and tip your ride share driver.
USC,"If you don't tip like at least $1.75 which is same as bus fare I have no respect for you cuz Lyft does not pay them enough lol hope he gets stopped but also hope Lyft is held accountable for not paying their drivers. He was prob sick of not getting tipped doing rides at the supposed University of Privileged Children, but that's def not okay to assume and do it himself."
USC,"This happened to me too! Fuck lyft man this is mow twice that this has happened!

This is malicious intent! We should fuck up lyft Twitter!"
USC,"I found the same problem. I got charged by Nicolas in August and thought it was my mistake, but just found another tip to Nicolas on Nov 1st. I’ll contact Lyft on twitter, but just wondering if anyone has reported the issue to our school? It’s definitely fraud."
USC,"This is kind of late, but will you guys stop blaming the drivers for this bs. I'm almost 100% certain it's not even the drivers ripping you off. Lyft is to blame. I know a driver who wasn't even getting 50% of his tips from Lyft. He found this out after a customer tipped him, then customer stayed in his car to make sure he got the tip. He never did receive it. Customer and my friend exchanged contact info and screenshots for proof. My friend contacted a lawyer and easy win for my friend in getting compensated well over 10k. Lyft settled out of court and Lyft didn't even deny the claim against them. This leads me to believe that the company itself is led by a bunch of crooks. They know it is cheaper to payout drivers who catch them stealing tips then to genuinely give drivers 100%. Moral of this story? I'd bet Lyft is charging customers tips and stashing the"
USC,Yeah it’s taken forever to get connected to a ride this week. Idk what’s up
USC,Might as well just walk to somewhere else in the Fryft zone if it's safe because it will be quicker.
USC,They take forever not just for Fryft but for Uber as well.
USC,"+1 on this. They should have atleast told me the time I need to wait properly, not just 1 min BS. I'm now tired of wasting 20 min everyday (and call Uber afterward). 🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄"
USC,I waited like 30 minutes for a paid Lyft before just cancelling
USC,"USC will either:

1.	have a contract in place and this will not affect them. 
2.	drop lyft and go back to Uber. 
3.	drop lyft and expand campus cruiser program instead."
USC,The return of fryft!
USC,Does this mean a reduction in that higher shryft fee imposed this upcoming academic year isn’t happening?
USC,Dummping Lyft!
USC,"$5 would be excellent. You have a safe ride, the driver is treated well. Win win."
USC,"Student rides are less than 2 miles, your driver makes 72 cents per mile. You will have a hard time finding a driver for lyft downtown. I've done 5k rides and live downtown and its only worth it for drivers if there is a surge price with the trip. Lyft doesn't have surge anymore.

During events, football games, frat lot rides etc, I turn lyft off because they offer no surge bonus.

All that being said, I and the other drivers appreciate you asking about offering a tip. Thanks"
USC,Free????? Looks like I'm switching back to the Uber app
USC,"$5 is good for short rides, under 15 minutes of destination drive time."
USC,"60 cents per mile plus 20 cents per minute. (That's Uber) Therefore you should use the bus unless there are extra incentives for drivers on busy nights. Or new drivers desperate for any rides with guaranteed income.

In addition, go south or east is prohibited. $10 is recommended for any place other than West Hollywood. All is forgiven if you are dressed for a Bel Air house party like the students of the other U that is closer."
USC,"At least $5.  And drivers, stop promoting $1 tips."
USC,These rides are usually in a power Zone so  mines are like $6 per ride
USC,"It is called Fryft for a reason. Lyft pays them and your parents pay $60,000 for you to attend USC. Use the free benefits and don't do extra"
USC,"Lyft driver here. If you tip, awesome. If you don’t, I understand. I love working the USC area because most of you guys are nice and polite, you make a stressful job easier. So thank you. Just don’t slam the doors when you’re getting off the car, and acknowledge your driver; we are humans, and we’re here to help you out. Stay awesome USC people."
USC,Just be polite. Tip is not a big deal tbh. Drivers understand you guys are in school. Treat people how you’d like to be treated.
USC,I’m a driver that comes to usc frequently and generally the students don’t tip.
USC,I always tip 2 dollars - but I would love to know what’s usc pays though. Yesterday there was a surge and it listed 30 bucks on receipt (all covered by usc) - does usc pay anything close to that amount - what does the driver make from that?
USC,"Tbh i used to but my trips are always so short like all <5 minutes. But tip if you can!

now i only do if the driver really goes out of their way to be friendly. Like when a driver wanted to know about my student experience and wished me good luck on finals"
USC,"I’ll tip when the driver get off to help me with the trunk, you know sometimes with a lot of bags from Ralphs"
USC,"Always tip your driver. 

Honestly these guys and gals are working full time on that app. The app absolutely considers the generosity of customers as part of their pay. Every little bit helps, even if it’s a buck. 

As many drivers have chimed in, they get it. Broke college students don’t tip much, if at all. But keep in mind (I know this from experience), Uber does everything it can to pass on the cost to the driver to limit their potential losses and increase profitability. 

No one is Ubering because they want to. Try and be kind if you can."
USC,yes lol they’re still lyft drivers…
USC,"I always tip $5. I don't have a lot of money, but I figure I'm not paying for the ride, but I can at least pay a $5 tip. If I don't have money to tip, I can walk within the Fryft zone. I don't have a lot of money, but my mom raised me to be a good tipper."
USC,"Hahaha I have this same offer (111 rides Fri to sun) except they only offered me an extra $130 for completing it...

😂😂

Lyft got jokes, that's for sure!!"
USC,That's too many rides in just 3 days
USC,"Normally I would say yes, but I believe this driver works that area with a strong and smart filtering strategy and sadly had ran into some issues. Check out his post and past market reporting comments, he is a good contributor 

Best of luck ✊

USC,Yeah USC can get this done  Friday and Saturday nights for sure. But do filler rides during the day for like 5 hours when when 6pm hits go straight to usc and just stay there. You can get 30/40 rides between 6pm and 2am over there
USC,$15.50/per ride. Don't get overly excited.
USC,"No, it is not.  They will make it sure it doesn't happen.  I used to drive in that area.  12 hours for 3 days netted me around 90 rides."
USC,111 rides in 3 days? Wtf
USC,"Here’s the Final Update for my LA Earnings Guarantee

USC,Check local FB groups and local drivers you know. Chances are if you got it many others did as well. Dangle a big enough carrot so all drivers try and few can do it.
USC,It’s not a bonus it’s a guarantee and this is Lyft asking you to kill yourself . This is wrong
USC,And we can only add max one more person to our ride and I think it’s too cheap.
FSU,I got an Uber at 3:00 AM when I flew out Thanksgiving. You’ll be fine.
FSU,"i’ve done it before at 4am! if it makes you feel better, you can schedule the uber ahead of time"
FSU,"Tallahassee has a population of 200,000 people it’s not rural America with no Uber drivers lol"
FSU,"Today, Uber just added tipping. 

To be honest, the fact that you didn't have to tip in Uber is one of the things that made it attractive to use. The price I paid is the price I paid. I can give cash tips if I really feel like they went above and beyond, but the service and payment set-up was pretty straightforward. If drivers didn't like the cut they were getting then they could choose to drive less or not at all. The restriction in driver supply should cause prices to increase to make up somewhat for the lack of tipping. "
FSU,"[As a former driver](http://imgur.com/a/iYzve) for Lyft, I highly endorse them. Just don't try to make a doc off it as most people (at least in ATL) just wanted to get where they were going."
FSU,"So I hadn't taken either of these services on my own until actually having earned income in my account, and I am sure that some students can and do afford rideshare services, but that is a fairly small minority of students. I will say from experience that most students are either too ""poor"" (for lack of a better word) or too financially conscious to afford rideshares. That said, my two cents on Uber and Lyft for those who can afford to take them:

I've had more consistent (and usually positive) experiences with Uber, while my Lyft experiences have ranged from drunk/stoned drivers swerving off the side of the road at odd moments, and rambling motor mouths who make Travis Bickle look positively sane... to genuinely good drivers who take what they are doing seriously. I will follow up on this that Lyft does have the better business model and genuinely treats its drivers better, and is a lot more innovative in ways that Uber has been noticeably slow to pick up on. However, Lyft is definitely more of a gamble. 
"
FSU,Wouldn't drivers prefer cash tips? Since they're under the table and not taxable.
FSU,In the past I easily got rides for early flights! Not sure if anything has changed in the last few months.
FSU,tbh i’ve always had problems getting ubers early in the morning for the same reason. I recommend calling yellow cab it’s cheaper and much more reliable in my opinion
FSU,I scheduled a 4 am Uber to the airport the day before thanksgiving and it worked fine
FSU,I've had no problems ever getting rides for early flights
FSU,5:45am isn't that early. Plenty of people are going to work around that time so there are generally plenty of Ubers out. I only ever had trouble getting an uber at like 4am.
FSU,the problem with scheduling is they jack the price up ($45 vs. $15 most other times) Nole cab seems cheaper. what day are u flying? my nole will be going to the airport on tue at 5am if y’all want to share a ride
FSU,i’ve had no issues getting an uber at like 3:30am to the airport
FSU,if uber doesn’t work look into getting a cab
FSU,I have always found a ride but the security line can be real long early in the morning. Definitely give yourself some time.
FSU,I’ve mostly had trouble getting Ubers/Lyfts late at night to go home from the airport. Early morning has been fine for me
FSU,"Honestly, Uber is more reliable for early mornings and usually cheaper as well. Lyft is better closer to late morning and afternoons. Otherwise, you can use yellow cab, they charge a flat 20 fee for rides to the airport."
FSU,Call Yellow Cab the day before to set up a ride. Far more reliable than the rideshares. They also have a student discount for pre-scheduled rides. 850-999-9999
FSU,About a month ago we used Uber and messaged for a ride at 4:00am to the airport. Driver was here in ten minutes. Of course as always YMMV.
FSU,"I've never had luck getting a lyft that early, scheduling or no scheduling. It doesn't matter if you schedule if no one shows up."
FSU,I’ve never had issues taking the 4/5 am Lyft to the airport as long as I scheduled it. Usually runs about $25.
FSU,I Lyft just lmk what day and I’ll go online
FSU,I've taken cabs at 5:30 in the morning to go places. Uber is pretty reliable and cheaper than Lyft at that hour. 1-2 people might cancel but someone will definitely turn up. Keep an extra 30 minutes in hand.
FSU,Uber/Lyft prices are crazy high and there aren’t many when you look them up. One thing I have learned is that you need a car/carpool to get around. Maybe I’m speaking for myself but the transportation sucks in Tallahassee.
FSU,"between covid risk, and UI extensions (for drivers who lost their main gigs,) a lot of drivers are just not being incentivized enough to be on the roads right now.

try to preschedule on uber when you can."
FSU,"To me it's less stressful to bring your own car, especially if you wanna get off campus. But if you plan to mostly stay on campus and you're getting the dining plan, then I think you'll be fine, but even then, there is a bus that goes to Publix. To me it really depends on you and if you're used to having your own car and driving around versus taking buses and Uber. But I also would consider how you're going to get home for the breaks if you don't bring own car. You could use Greyhound or rely on your parents or your friends (from your home town) to drive you home. I know a lot of people have bikes/scooters and use those, but no personal experience."
FSU,"Having a moped/motorcycle is an extremely nice thing to have around campus (especially for actually finding parking). However, you have to be super careful as they are prone to be hit by distracted drivers and are easy to steal (definitely get a lock). Good luck!"
FSU,"Could have a car, use bus and Uber for nearby locations. I’d want my car in case I wanted to go to the beach."
FSU,"So when in the proper zone, is it best to Lyft instead of snap? Snap instead of Lift?"
FSU,"Its 50% off between those hours but they also give u some free rides! Every year I think I get 5 free rides, it’s so awesome. Sometimes tho it gets really busy and u have to take an uber or wait super long"
FSU,"I’m shocked so many people don’t know about the UF Lyft pass. My friends constantly complain about how expensive Uber is and REFUSE to download Lyft even though I keep telling them about it! 

Anywhere on campus for like a dollar or two. It’s awesome!"
FSU,"Just a warning to others - I tried to use this last Friday night around 10:30 and Lyft couldn't find a driver (tried twice over 40 mins, just ended up paying full price for an Uber before it got even later) so be sure to have a backup plan!!"
FSU,I have 15$ lyft passes for 5$ dm me

(I used to rideshare a lot}"
SDSU,"This is why I don’t drive anymore. My second pax ever, not an assist ride, was an elderly man with a broken hip in a wheelchair. I had to fully lift him into my car. His wife promised there would be someone to get him out when we arrived at their care home. There was not. I called support after I lifted him out of my car and got him inside, just to gain some clarity on the liabilities of such a ride. I talked to three people who said they understood what I was asking. A few moments later, I started getting a bunch of emails saying that I need to agree to terms of service. When I got home, I called again and after speaking to five different people, the last one told me there was a note in my file stating I don’t want to help disabled people. I was like, wth, I went above and beyond and did help him. They wouldn’t remove the note and assured me that I still had a five star rating. I said I don’t care about the rating and that was my last day driving."
SDSU,"This was just suggested on my feed-I’m not a driver, nor a customer (we don’t have Lyft in the boonies).

WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?  Having that as an option is outrageous. Pizza delivery people probably get paid more for delivering a pizza safely. They want you to transport high risk people with a $4 base pay?  Oooooo boy, no way.  I mean, it’s just laughable how obscene this is."
SDSU,OP you are extremely smart for avoiding a lawsuit. It is a horrible deal. You bring up a lot of extremely valid points. The liabilities are endless for Lyft assisted. Thank you. BTW you are not a disgusting person. You are very smart and know what dangers could happen if something was to occur.
SDSU,Yeah it’s ridiculous how little they offer for these rides. They’re also probably paid for by insurance companies and billed at rates comparable to hospital
SDSU,"They do this in my market without even paying any extra and we have no choice. They come in as regular rides with comments like ""Passenger has Walker and will need assistance with groceries and getting into vehicle"" It's total BS!"
SDSU,God bless them but there should be some sort of government transportation for these type of folks with training. Lyft is pushing their hand. Independent contractors didn’t sign up for that. Even for 20$ I wouldn’t want to do it to be honest.
SDSU,"As a disabled rider, I actually don’t like this. People who try to touch, grab or “help” disabled people without getting permission from the person can be charged with literal assault and I’ve never had a bad experience with a driver that would make me think Assist was necessary or even a good idea. 

I use an ultralight manual wheelchair, and the wheels come off with quick release bolts. If I have someone with me, I get into the car while my companion pops the wheels off and throws the whole thing into the trunk. It’s tiny. If I don’t have help, I can’t do it. 

Here’s the thing though: if someone else touches the chair and something breaks, it voids the warranty. Para transit won’t even do it (and I can’t touch their tie-downs; only the diver can; everyone has to be the only person touching their own equipment.) This happened once. A driver was trying to lock my chair’s brakes and accidentally snapped a brake handle off. I was told I would have to file a police report before the warranty would cover repair (I didn’t even consider doing that I was able to fix it myself; not the end of the world.)

I always send a message to the driver like “hi, can we use your trunk space for a collapsible wheelchair?” And have always been told “yes” or “if it fits” (it always does). I’ve had drivers ask if they can give me help with the chair and I say something like “thanks but no, we need to be the only people putting hands on it so if damage happens, we are the only ones legally responsible. 

Lyft Assist sounds like a terrible idea.  Customer service have told me I should be using that to let the driver know I have a disability.  I’m imagining a driver grabbing me. I have called 911 about strangers touching me without permission. Whatever you may think about how I’m an ingrate who doesn’t understand the kindness of strangers, I’m not the only disabled person I know who has done that. But think about it: if Lyft is telling me I should use Lyft assist, and Lyft is telling drivers they should be physically touching disabled passengers, and medical equipment manufacturers tell you that if someone else touches the chair you MUST file a police report, this really looks like drivers are being set up to take a fall. 

Also, I thought that “give additional tip for using the trunk space” was standard rider etiquette. It’s what people do when they’re using Lyft to get all their groceries home from the supermarket. $4 is about right (2 for trunk space, 2 for the drivers waiting time) and it’s literally not worth that to y’all to take the legal risk. In my state, you need training and  background checks to do chair-to-car transfers. Even handi-van drivers aren’t allowed to. I don’t know what Lyft is thinking putting drivers in that position. If a rider needs a transfer assist, there’s medical transportation and helpers with CNA licenses. Lyft cannot be telling you to literally touch someone."
SDSU,"We don’t have medical transport liability insurance. Rideshare coverage is expensive enough, we aren’t part of a company with that kind of training and insurance backing us. This is a very bad idea. SMDH"
SDSU,"Never heard of this, but thanks for sharing. It's just a total no-go unless you're a rideshare superhero."
SDSU,"I didn’t even realize this was a thing. I think for rides like these maybe there should at least be some training in how to transfer people to/from wheelchairs, some basic medical knowledge, basic dementia training, etc. These type of rides should be marketed to someone who is a CNA or other type of medical professional who maybe wants to supplement their income. Lifting/transferring someone in and out of a car can hurt you (or pax) pretty badly if not done correctly."
SDSU,"There are agencies that work with those with disabilities that are trained and covered to provide these services. Sadly they can't maintain staffing, at least in my region. The agency I get help from with independent living can't find anyone so they get approval to outsource to Uber. It's a nightmare of a resolution for clients, and I feel terrible for drivers. They don't sign up for this, and none seem to know when coming that this is the case. 

&#x200B;

As great as a platform and service it is, it would be nice to keep the medical transportation, non-medical disability related transportation, and uber/lyft as separate platforms and systems. As a consumer of all of these, it's frustrating as of last couple years to have Uber and Lyft being the go-to for everything."
SDSU,"Most of those rides come with a text message as soon as you accept it [please call rider upon arrival wheelchair/leg assistance needed] I cancel immediately, I'm not medical transport.... the last time i did that the ride took 25 minutes for only a 4 mile trip....."
SDSU,"We are not trained for that shit, and the pay is not enough ... #FuckLyft"
SDSU,I get the pov of the drivers but this thread is a rough read if you have a disability.
SDSU,"On one hand, Lyft is trying to be an affordable option for those who need it most. On the other hand, para-transport should be cheaper, and widely available."
SDSU,"Not a driver, but I have integrated with the main competitors' version of this as an early customer.

Corporate was literally lying their ass off to the companies that they partner to build demand for this service with. The main competitor actually told my company all these tales about how the drivers get extra training and stricter validation so they can provide what is effectively a medical livery service. No such training happened. More than half the drivers were not aware that the trips were special. It was just an upcharge to the X SUV level in practice.  


Likely Lyft is doing the same thing, but at least they're giving you a measly $4 in kickbacks lol"
SDSU,"“Oh so helping ppl is a bad thing now. You sound like a disgusting person” oh pls, stfu. $4 is not enough to deal with the extremities that come with helping the elderly or disabled sometimes. If Lyft really cares, get specialized ppl to do it."
SDSU,"Not to mention that most of these facilities have their own transportation services. We're just cheap labor on call so their drivers earn the same pay but can pass off their cheap patients with cheap insurance to us.

For me, I had a scheduled ride that was great pay from a dialysis center and he was quiet but good dude. The last scheduled ride I got I waited and a doctor came out. I asked for the guy and was told he's in the hospitals hands now.

There hasn't been a schedule ride or even a basic ride that matches that route. It's around the corner for me so it was a convenient ride straight from my own neighborhood.

For me I have alot of regular faces that I get along with as is and I just don't feel like bumming myself out. There are plenty of drivers who will take these anyway for cheap"
SDSU,"Pretty much. I do both Lyft and Uber and people still order UberX for their grandparents that need assistance and here's the thing. I'm 6ft 230lbs I lift weights squat move etc not bragging but Def the son his mom calls to move furniture/shovel snow. And boy howdy do some of these elderly let themselves go I almost threw my back out helping this old guy out not just cuz he was heavy but cuz he decided to fall into me and I caught him and didn't let him collapse onto the cement. My heart jumped.cuz all I thought was ""oh no he died right in my arms"" 
Cuz he had to wake up while I was still awkwardly angled holding him. Oh and his son & daughter whichever one was the in law just gawked at me like ""oh that's papa playing pranks again"" and I look up going ""is he alright"" 
Just ""oh he must have gotten light headed standing"" 
I'm from Chelsea ma I've seen people die from slipping and hitting the curb with their head or neck I've seen people hit by cars going 60 on a 35. I know for a fact I kept this guy alive another day cuz he 100% would be GONE had he hit the sidewalk. They don't even acknowledge what I just did I'm holding passed out 250+lbs of dead weight by the armpits 2 feet from the ground. (No it is nothing like a deadlift ) I didn't want a tip I just wanted to get out of there. My back was messed up for a few days after that and I was panicking to get a weird report from the company that they might report me cuz they seemed the type to get 5star service and still send a report for free shit."
SDSU,Even if we didn't sign up for it Lyft will probably match you when it's busy and no drivers are taking it.
SDSU,Any and all low paying medical rides are an automatic decline/cancel. We don't get paid enough to accept trash can pay in comparison to what Healthcare workers get paid
SDSU,"Honestly, it came in clutch for me when i couldn’t find anyone to take me home from a colonoscopy. It’s the only rideshare option the facility would let me use. I didn’t need any help, just was too drowsy to drive."
SDSU,I knew this when they first offered Lyft assisted.  I've had enough problems with blind people getting regular Lyft rides so fuck all that shit.
SDSU,Of course. Standard Lyft and above rides only.
SDSU,I work in an ER and we frequently set up Ubers for patients that the hospital pays for. I don’t know how this works for the drivers but I know I always feel so bad for them for some of the smelly degenerates getting in their car. But at least they have to be ambulatory and alert/oriented for us to be able to do it. This shit sounds like a bad deal.
SDSU,they are probably charging a ton from these elderly customers but only paying a fraction ($4) to the drivers. just another way to leech off of the people who are actually performing services.
SDSU,"Have a little compassion, you'll be old too. I love getting assist. They always tip. $5 + 100% of the time.  Old people somehow love me. Just the other day I picked up an elderly lady opened and closed the door and got her stuff in the car, when I got to her drop off she asked me if I could help her open her door in the garage because it was too heavy for her, gladly did with no sour puss face. Handed me a folded bill, and said thank you. Got in the car opened it up and it was a $20. On top of that her niece tipped $7 off the app, she order her the ride. All of my assist always tip. Yes, it's a little more work, but I don't do it for the money, I have compassion for them. Life's already hard for them, kindness goes a long way."
SDSU,"Okay so I have a relevant anecdote here. I’m not a Lyft or Uber driver but just a week ago, a car pulled up to my neighbor’s house across the street. Old lady gets out - probably in her 60’s. Has a cane and starts hobbling up the driveway. She’s clearly not my neighbor, but I figure she has business to conduct. She struggles to get up the driveway, taking a good 2 minutes to hobble up about 20 feet. She grabs some plastic bin the neighbor had set out for her and starts the long trek back to the car. Meanwhile the driver can’t be bothered to get out of his car. At this point I’m legitimately worried this lady is going to fall over so I step up and walk over and offer her my arm to lean on so she can get back to the car safely. She proceeds to tell me she had a stroke recently and can’t use the entire left side of her body. She said she tipped the driver extra to get out and grab the bin for her, but he ignored the request. Anyway, she easily could have fallen or worse. So ya, this shit happens. 

The bin was worth about $5 tops secondhand (actually it was a used pet carrier). This lady paid who knows how much to have a driver pick her up, drive her to this house, and pick up a piece of plastic worth less than $5. Not exactly good judgement."
SDSU,"I wouldn't sign up for that shit for $400 a ride. For all the liability reasons you listed. Their insurance policy is important the toilet paper it's written on in shit. Damn sure it's never going to cover you while you're helping a little old lady to her door and she falls down and breaks a hip. This is bad as Uber's partnership with go go grandparent. I've never not canceled one of those rides. And I get it, I'm an asshole. But I'll tell you what I'm not. And that's a licensed caregiver. They have ride services for these people with drivers specifically trained and paid to do this kind of work. How many Uber and Lyft drivers are there that know what a DNR is? Or whether or not that person has one on file? I promise you lifting Uber's insurance is not going to cover you if little old granny decides to kill over and you provide life saving CPR and she has a DNR on file. Welcome to liability from hell if you manage to save her life, or in some cases even attempt to. Absolutely no incentives that either of these companies can provide to give these rides is worth it."
SDSU,"Actually, I get those rides all the time, and they aren't even marked as assisted.  I also had to help a terminally ill cancer patient into a hospital outside the city that had no cooperation with lyft because his anti-white nurse intentionally sent him to the wrong place... and it wasn't marked as assisted.  It took more than an hour onsite to coordinate between the clinics rather than to abandon a poor terminally ill man outside the wrong clinic.  Lyft gave me like an extra 2 dollars because of the time spent."
SDSU,Stop protesting and start turning down every shitty ride offer.  Everyone has to do this.
SDSU,Good for them! Drivers should be united together
SDSU,I propose we make a free app on android and ios that allows for uber and lyft drivers to organize and strategize in every city. Sponsorships for the app could include university ads and fitness ads. Healthy stuff ;) Whoever has programming knowledge could help. The App will help connect less tech savvy drivers with this beautiful movement toward fair wages..
SDSU,Lyft rips drivers off and they still don’t make a dime in profit.
SDSU,Lyft riders or drivers?
SDSU,Silly drivers…. So many easier ways to make a living
SDSU,"The real answer is simple, every ride we see what we pay Lyft and what rider pays us.

Allegedly we pay them instead of them paying us, so to make everything perfect, we should see what rider pays every request and see what we are offered overt request.

Would fix 99% of problems because drivers would know when to refuse.

Other 1% is they have to fix destination changes. Rider needs to be told that they will pay the same even if they choose a shorter location afterwards. Price should never go lower unless the driver authorizes it. 

Also, bad ratings should be negated when rider changes to a shorter trip to avoid shenanigans."
SDSU,They would need to burn down a Lyft hub in order to really get them to give a rat's ass about us
SDSU,Rideshare was never intended and cannot be your main hustle/job. But do your thang more power 🙏🏾
SDSU,"If all drivers actually united, ants included, we would all be living a lot better."
SDSU,Fck lyft
SDSU,"Yea, like that's going work. Lyft doesn't care. That's the biggest roadblock, indifference."
SDSU,"I think both Lyft and Uber are way overdue for a full fledged stay off the app strike until they start paying us a decent amount for making them millions on a daily basis. They're using and ripping us off. We're paying all maintenance, fuel, insurance... everything while they're making all the money. Change will not happen until us drivers force them. LET'S STRIKE LYFT AND UBER FOR BETTER PAY AND REAL SUPPORT."
SDSU,"My condolences. Sending thoughts and prayers on behalf of Lyft because we all know their support system is garbage, and they have not a dime to spare for those that cover the low volume times."
SDSU,"This is better than in Northern CA. Lyft offers nothing but shit $4, $5, and $6 dollar rides. Anything over $10 either has multiple stops or covers a long distance paying 50c a mile. Lyft is fuckin worthless if there are no streak bonuses. Speaking of which, haven't seen a streak bonus or ride challenge in close to 2 months. I basically treat Lyft like a destination filter"
SDSU,What area are you in and how many rides did you decline?
SDSU,"Dave drove for an hour between 430 - 530 because there was a surge for the after work crowd! Dave was planning to stay out until 8, but at 530 the rides started to slow down and offers became unacceptably low, so Dave went home after having made $28 in an hour! Dave doesn’t drive if the money isn’t there! 

Be like Dave!"
SDSU,11hrs and only 9 rides = 119$ WTH did you do with all that time?
SDSU,"Time to get a big boy/girl job and work for the man! Everyone wants ""job freedom"". So everyone works for gig apps and the pay goes lower and lower. Supply and demand. 2024 will be even worse. Idiots will end up paying to drive for Uber/Lyft, im convinced of it."
SDSU,I would say they a different app if it's that bad in your market. For sure run both lyft and uber. At least you got some tips sprinkled in there. I'm constantly checking both app and just do what ever one is better. In my area at least I .take more on uber but lyft gives me better streak bonus. For reference I have about 15k rides on uber and 4k on lyft. Over about 7 years
SDSU,Wow I made this in 2 and 1/2 hours yesterday morning doing Uber
SDSU,"It’s drivers like you that make drivers like me $75/hr. 

Lyft takes 50% of your fares because you drive when there’s no demand
Lyft gives me a surge that is equal to that 50% they took from you because I only drive when there is demand

But go ahead … keep grossin’ $12/hr why slowly destroying your body. 

It’s not a job. It’s barely a gig. Stop trying to make it one."
SDSU,I can make $300 in 12 hours with Uber in DFW daily. You gotta use Lyft to supplement for Uber. It's mostly crap.
SDSU,"That’s over $10 per ride, nice job you earned it. Pay some bills and buy something nice or take yourself out to dinner."
SDSU,You made $120.....you make it seem like you earned just $5.00!! Too many entitled drivers....get humbled.
SDSU,It gets worse here in Ohio yesterday in Columbus. I’ve made close to $200 in 9 hours wtf I’m already looking for a job fuck Lyft
SDSU,"In DC they removed the graphic chart showing busy times bc likely too many complained it wasn’t accurate.  I USED that every weekend to decide when to drive peak. One by one I have decreased hours on Lyft bc I can’t reach a human, pay falls, bonuses have evaporated, and here lately tips are higher on Uber."
SDSU,Only problem is— Dave cannot afford to Live In America anymore because he doesn’t have three jobs. That’s why Dave is doing Ride share when the robots navigating his life to chase the money.
SDSU,9 rides in 11 Hours and 53mins that math is not adding up
SDSU,what kind of car do you have? just curious. i’m in the bay area (mainly SF) and if i put in those hours i’m getting no less then $300-550. I do a lot of airport rides though.
SDSU,"Keep it going. Let's say you waste 5 seconds each time you receive a shitty request like 10 mile drive 1 dollar 79 cents (pick-up bonus included) and it shows the same ride to a 30 different driver in the area. That is 2 minutes 30 seconds of extra waiting time for rider to find a ride, that could have been avoided if they stopped being the greedy assholes they are."
SDSU,"Lyft knows me, you better throw a $15 or more streak at me if you want me accepting ever ride!"
SDSU,"I doubt the veracity of their claim regarding ""typical drivers"".  It would be even less effective for them to say, *""Hey, we know most drivers rejects these garbage rides, but can you do us a solid and help out?""*"
SDSU,"Work for yourself Be Your Own Boss, also accept every ride or will kick you off the platform."
SDSU,"Lyft is NOT a community. It’s a for profit, publicly traded POS corporation that rips independent contractors off."
SDSU,I talked to two drivers tonight and they aren't phased. Goobers taking every ride. Mafffs shoulda been taught in grade school.
SDSU,Just means you’re making more money than the other drivers in your area. Can’t conceive any situation where acceptance rate for Lyft or uber should be above 20 percent nowadays.
SDSU,28% right now. I might turn the app on & bring it down even lower maybe that’s where the fair priced rides are? 😂
SDSU,Just ignore it. I had 100% acceptance rate and declined a ride once because I was trying to log off when I got the request and didn't want to do a 20-minute trip I wanted to go home. So I declined that trip and I immediately got that message.
SDSU,I got a saucy email about waiting it the timer ⏱ of all things 🥴. I responded to the wind about not how running out the timer is a safety feature. Lyft has the dumbest takes with their emails and a shit attitude with its drivers. The app is trash.
SDSU,"Depending on your area, driving for a couple hours each day riding streaks can gross you a good ~1000-1500 a month with minimal work, but lyft will lower your streak rate regularly if you ride those times too much; Uber requirements are a bit stricter with drivers than lyft."
SDSU,"Multi app because each app has different rates at the same time and that’s what the customers are doing to get the lowest price. Some days it’s non stop on Uber and dead on Lyft and visa Versa. Keep detailed receipts on everything for taxes such as mileage, car wash pass, etc"
SDSU,I’ve been stuck in this Lyft rental program for a month slaving away and it helped me out because I was out of a car but they pay you less when using the rental. I struggled to make the payment. I’m just now getting out of it
SDSU,"Rental programs are a joke and predatory, nothing new

Most markets you want the ability to use Uber and Lyft, but with rentals, you can't."
SDSU,"I asked about this yesterday but IMO the only viable reason to rent a car is if your car is in the shop needing repairs or as in my case, I was thinking of doing it just to test the waters of doing Lyft/Uber type driving but don’t currently have a qualifying vehicle to do it. Mainly in order to see if I like doing it and test the waters of my area before buying a used car."
SDSU,"Just sharing my two cents here with the Lyft express drive: i just got out of it today, it was a month and a half of mixed feelings with the car. I got better tips and i worked pretty much every day for 10 hours. Yes, gas took away a good chunk but I got enough to pay my bills and stay afloat while looking for another car and another job. I got those last week. For me it worked out okay but the fees are ridiculously high and gas prices are no help either. Ponder your options if you are out of a car and need one. But you really gotta get out of it quickly and get a steady income besides Lyft."
SDSU,"Per mile and per minute rate is less with a rental then it is normally! Do not rent from Lyft , modern day slavery"
SDSU,"Hey that's crazy I LITERALLY been waiting for one of these posts to pop up for like 2 weeks now , so I was driving for Lyft for a month I was homeless my older cousin helped me get the deposit and helped me get a bank account , I had a electric car a kira Niro Ev 2023 the first few weeks was cool and chill I wasn't really bothered by nobody for perspective (I'm black 25 with 1 daughter in my life a newborn to be exact) so you can imagine nothing really bothers me from arguing amongst riders people eating in the car people tryna flirt with you ( both female and male) 
It wasn't till maybe the month mark I started noticing little things like for one my weekly rental fee supposed to be 330 nothing higher or more that's with the insurance and fees they said man I noticed I been getting 487 weekly rental charges weekly and then I noticed the toll of driving all day and night then driving back home  I would drive in Sacramento all over to the valley and Santa Cruz but nobody told me that for one that there's no evcs chargers down the central valley area as far as level 3 and up be lucky there's a level 2 around , then the slow days I gotten so many slow days in the valley I never drove in Stockton for the reason of a bad experience of almost getting shot during a ride , like I literally had to either sleep in the car for the weekdays to actually have energy to drive to Sacramento  then drive back home , I wasn't eating cause I wouldn't make enough money it was just so many variables and Lyft was just no help at all I was a pure t star driver not one single low review or none of that platinum driver and what Lyft do leave out vital information I learned to only drive for Lyft and Uber with your own car or have a job on top before even driving Lyft cause those fees are ridiculous but on the bright side of you get in a accident in they car you can always get you a new one as long as it wasn't your fault"
SDSU,"I rent a car and pocket about 800-1000 after rental fee and gas per week driving 6 days 8-10 hours. I live in a big city. Personally this is enough to live on and save quite a bit too. The money is there if you put the time in, but the hours could bother some people. Lyft barely feels like work to me so I'm able to easily grind the 50-60 hours per week without burnout."
SDSU,"I crashed their shit car, didn't even pay the 500 deductible, still let me drive for them in the new whip before completely quiting shit exploitative ride share gigs"
SDSU,"Got a rental as my car was hit by a DD while I slept. 

My area flexdrive just bought a ton of hybrids 2023. I got one. Had 7 miles on it when I picked it up. I get about 50 mpg and fill up every 2 days of driving vs everyday in my personal vehicle. 

It is 300 a week towards the rental and fees but I am going to get reimbursed on that from either my insurance or the DDs insurance. (DD insurance is trying to claim the driver was not insured.)

But yeah the rates are lower. But the gas is much better. 30 bucks every 2 days. 

You have to put on miles for it to be worth it."
SDSU,Rented for a year loved and hated it never had a problem until my car broke down. Hertz billed me for the world and claims I still owe $150 today. They don’t care about anyone lyft nor hertz will help me. So I’m done with the both of them forever…
SDSU,I drove my own vehicle- a 2020 Chevy Traverse for a couple months last year for Uber and Lyft. An 8-passenger car supposedly gets the premium rate per trip. I was shocked at the low payouts I was getting daily versus the mileage and wear on my vehicle so I quit. Turns out the Detroit (mine) and San Francisco markets have the 2 lowest payout rates in the nation. Fucking ripoff.
SDSU,Renting is easy for me because I can actually make $300 a day but only on Mondays....For some reason it's more profitable. I don't have to worry about maintenance..All I have to do is put gas and keep it clean...You have to grind I'm already into making my money. Plus I drive a M7 series Beamer I can protect my investment by keeping my mileage down... To each its own....I still can make at least about $1k a week....What y'all doing? I know Lyft plays games but I only do rides that makes sense time wise and money wise....Maybe not look for big long trips...I take short to somewhat medium rides
SDSU,"Lyft, Uber or whoever the fuck else is in business for one reason to make a profit.  They don't give a fat babies ass except for their bottom line.  The fact that these COCKSUCKERS can get away with taking almost 2/3rds of the fare is outrageous.  It wasn't like that when it started but now that so many people are out of work the gig economy is overflowing with people which allows them to fuck all of us with a soft dick.  This is the way of the world. They also know that the majority of the people who drive for them don't have the necessary degrees to do anything better.  Now degrees don't equate to intelligence it's nothing more than a passport to get your foot in the building with still no guarantee for a job.  It also doesn't help that this country is a corporation run by corporations.  For instance look what happened recently in Illinois(correct me if I'm wrong), where the Governor who was clearly bought By Uber vetoed a bill that would made drivers employee's and not contractors. If this would have passed it would have created a snowball affect to other states and cities. So don't ever expect a company like Uber who made a net profit of over 14 billion to give a fuck about us...14 billion dollars and all they are is nothing more than a match making app for car services."
SDSU,"It’s not for everyone or every market. I managed to pay my 260 every weekend in two days over the span of 6 hrs each day. The rest of the week was gravy. I could do more rides or a regular job/side hustle. $10 of gas got me $200 in rides or other. You think your own car will be any better? Let’s say $500 for your car payment…$200 for your insurance. Gas…. Then incidentals like new tires…. Maintenance… it’s the same shit just how you pay for it. You pay 1000 a month but don’t have to also save half of your income incase shit happens to your car. Tires all four will be $800 upfront. With the rental you pay for the rental that week not $800. There are pros and cons and If you hustle it’s doable if you don’t like hustling and choosing what days you do what and when…then yes the rental is not for you. Your market can suck also making the rental a bad move too, but it also isn’t a bad move for everyone. 

It’s not for you if you have a car with a car payment. 
It’s not for you if your market sucks ass
It’s not for you if you can afford and are capable of getting a car financed. 
It’s not for you if you aren’t structured in your work."
SDSU,Big scam i grinded a month upgraded to Tesla rental to save on gas i was doing $80 gas daily driving 12hrs online time. if you don’t plan to drive 7 days a week 9-12 hrs you will find yourself in a big financial hole also with hertz rental thru Uber. Thankfully i stopped. Did school full time got nice financial aid check nd put that down on a 2021 Prius prime now I’m back driving lyft nd It’s worth it.
SDSU,Reminds me of predatory yellow cab practices. Except those drivers were forced to borrow up to $100K and basically be enslaved for decades to pay it off. At least you can get out of this one in a month.
SDSU,AGREED!  I’m in the hole with Lyft due to the ridiculous electric car rental they offered.  I was given rides as low as $2.30 and hardly ever received anything over $10….you literally work 24/7 and pay them an astronomical amount for the rental AND you are required to meet their minimum amount of drives also for the week.  Your literally working for them to increase their earnings and we get screwed!!
SDSU,i do not understand why anyone would choose this model unless lyft was their full-time job though. i make 400 a day but thats only with this as my main. i can’t survive with this as a side hustle
SDSU,"The rental program is really for full times drivers who average about 100-135 trips a week and make at least 1000-1500 a week.

Only way u can win otherwise is if you have other main sources of income. And u use Lyft to avoid putting miles on your car"
SDSU,"A heard about ""Ryde""  a decentralized  driver owned network, I hope they launch soon https://ryde.tech/"
SDSU,"Unfortunately Lyft and Uber have become modern day slavery, with no real intervention from the law they are literally paying about $7-8 per hour once you factor ALL the expenses plus taxes, McDonalds its a better option at this point  with the way they’re flat out taking 80% of what customers pay is just doesn’t make sense to do it at all"
SDSU,If anyone rents from left they are really stupid.   Look. If you don’t have a car then rideshare isn’t for you.   People are stupid
SDSU,Just went through this. It was easy. Everything was deductible. I owed $2 nd the filing fee for the $11k i generated in 3 months. 9k income. Worked rideshare for those 3 month yes. $2 dollars.
SDSU,Just keep on slaving until you can pay the minimum down payment for your own car. Then you won't be renting from Lyft and you'll get away from Lyft slavery and join in Grub hub Uber and other Slave apps.🥰 Keep stacking up and use the saving option in the Lyft Direct app of need be.
SDSU,I’ve been doing it for over a year. I have my reasons but honestly I make enough driving Uber and playing poker to cover the fee every week. They recently started requiring 20 rides per week which I’ll do when they offer a bonus and it cuts down the rental fee a bit.
SDSU,It's all part of the Lyft experience. Embrace the suck!   Lol
SDSU,Why not rent a car from somewhere else? Im not a lyft driver jw
SDSU,"I drive a rental and just started with Lyft. I stay outside Chicago, but went downtown and around lakeshore area. I’ve already made, more than my rental, within 3 days…maybe just focus on, making the rental first and then, do more rides, so you can have more money yourself. You signed up for the rental and knew, what came with it. I’d rather pay for a rental, than have all that damage/wear and tear, on my vehicle. Nothing wrong with, renting a car through Lyft"
SDSU,I was just talking to driver the other day and mentioned I might try driving with the Lyft and she mentioned this program. Definitely glad I read this post before signing up.
SDSU,All facts. I practically lived in my rental with Lyft. Ugh. But I ended up buying my own car.
SDSU,"I remember renting a few years back, they did note that people who rent with their express program do get paid less from their fares. And then a few months later they would even pay the express rental drivers even less when they updated the pricing.
This was when their cars was 274 a week. Excluding the 200 deposit."
SDSU,"Guys you have to put in the numbers different to see the whole figure in the end. 
The Lyft rental is now: 
$280      A WEEK
$1120     A MONTH
$13,340 A YEAR

Now think about…you buy for example a new Toyota Corolla Hybrid. On the Toyota Homepage this car cost you: 

Fair credit score of 650
Down $2000
48 Months finance 
———————————
Total: $605/ Month

So let’s compare:

                        Finance             Lyft Rental
Month             $605                 $1,120
Year                $7,260               $13,340
48 Months     $29,040            $53,340
Savings          $24,300            $0

————————————————————-
Bank savings 
account after 
48mo            + $34,300         + $0"
SDSU,"Yeah currently in this situation, 361 a week for the rental. Plus gas. But I need a car, and they make so much off you doing this! They even pay less per ride when you have one of the hertz vehicles!"
SDSU,I'm sorry mate :/ I live in San Diego myself and I see so many Uber / Lyft cars. Probably because there is an overflux of drivers. 
SDSU,"Barely $4 for driving 2 people, wow what kind of rates does San Diego have! man this is becoming ridiculous.  They should just increase prices and just end primetime or surge, that way drivers can make constant good money, and passengers won't be closing app when they see Primetime notification!"
SDSU,I cut off driving Lyft after 9AM at that point all the drivers are out and the app goes haywire.  It doesn’t matter how critical the need the algorithm doesn’t schedule trips fairly for all. That is why you have to keep moving which exhausts resources. It’s like they forgot to program the app to keep re pinging your location to the server. If you look at your battery usage you’ll see that Uber uses 3 to 4 Times more resources than what Lyft does that because Uber’s app never stops refreshing. Until Lyft admits the driver app as faulty were all going to be hurting. There’s 70 000 people in my city right now for a RV Heavy Equipment Expo Uber surging to 4.0 X and all I got in 4 hours on Lyft was $8 for 1 Ride. No one can tell me that’s due to low demand something is wrong with that app
SDSU,"$1,500 / 200 = $7.5
Take every single ride that pays less than $7.50"
SDSU,for 200 rides.... dang thats a lot for nothing
SDSU,"The older drivers pay the new drivers by being throttled so the new drivers get that lovely guarantee .

At what point to you realize they have always controlled what you make per ride ! Lol"
SDSU,"They’re guaranteeing you $1500 but if you make more the deal is off the table but if you make
$1,000 doing  200 rides they’ll give you the extra $500"
SDSU,When I started last august it was 1000 for 5 rides I haven’t been on in about almost three weeks waiting  for another incentive  to drive for them I’ve been doing mostly Uber the last few weeks and doing ok
SDSU,"Which is why I’m not doing a lot in my hometown during summer bc the summer drivers are being fed all the good work (made $200 a day just doing Uber my first week, not since by staying in town)"
SDSU,go to busy area that needs short rides.  Like bar area or college area.  Just do the $3/ 10 minute or less rides.
SDSU,"Pure garbage.  They know that $1500 on 200 rides will leave them owing you pennies.  Accepting only $3-4 rides is an option.  However, at that point, the guarantee is more of a rebate on lost time than actual profit."
SDSU,Oh...I see you caught on to Lyft word play. Yeah the guarantee bonuses are 🐂💩
SDSU,I can make 3500 in 200 rides wtf
SDSU,"Oh wow that sucks lol. It was $1400 guaranteed for 100 rides when I did it 2 years ago, ended up getting just over $600 after completing it."
SDSU,That's a real shitty one. 200 rides? You will probably surpass that 1500  around 100 or so rides
SDSU,"1500? Wow they lowered it. It was 3000 when I started 8 months ago. My advice is to take all rides. The lower the fare, the better the payout. 10 rides usually averages around 100 bucks for me in Phoenix. If you were at that rate here, you wouldn’t get that guarantee"
SDSU,You ONLY take short rides. Reject everything else.
SDSU,"Yeah, as guarantees go, that ones crap. I don’t even know that I’d bother. Look for the ones that are$15/ ride or more (depends on market, obv)."
SDSU,Guarantee vs bonus. 2 different concepts for Lyft.
SDSU,"That’s 7.50 per ride so take only short rides to make up for it. After Covid Lyft lowered their pay per mile, be smart not stupid."
SDSU,Take every short ride you can get.  Filter your rides thru a 5 mile radius or use the arrive on time filter and keep it within a half hour of your home by keeping the time within 30 minutes.
SDSU,"Yeah, mine was $200 for 3 rides. As a bonus though. Did 3 short rides the first day."
SDSU,"I got this offer, took every short and fast ride possible

Lyft has a radius filter to keep you in a certain area. 

Depending where you live, do it in a city center. 

I completed this in about 5 days and made about $600 got paid $900 from Lyft."
SDSU,$1500 for 200 rides is a scam it should be more like $4000 for 200 rides
SDSU,WELCOME TO LYFTONOMICS🤣
SDSU,"Run both apps, assuming you do uber too and cherry pick both apps. Ubers hot? Keep going on uber till you get a lfyt short. And back and forth. You'll knock it out and make money and stay busy"
SDSU,And if you make more - they will shadow ban you from good rides
SDSU,I once got an offer from Uber for $3200 guaranteed  for 270 rides did all the short rides pulled it off in 6 days
SDSU,Cherry pick the rides with short pick ups and short rides. You’ll only get paid $3-$4 each but they can be done quickly and Lyft will owe you a lot of money when you’re done.
SDSU,So give 200 rides to strangers and earn the same amount as someone on unemployment? Huge L
SDSU,So if you do 200 rides you get 1500$ plus the money you make for the 200 rides
SDSU,Man this one is cake. All 3-5 dollar rides. I’d be done in two weeks if I had this one.
SDSU,"You’ll easily get $1,500 with 200 trips and Lyft won’t give you anything sadly."
SDSU,Oh wow 7.5$ per ride! What a deal!!
SDSU,I just cherry picked the fastest rides when I get these
SDSU,"Can you read what it says? 

It says they can guarantee you will make at least $1500 in those 200 rides. If you are under that for some reason then they will make sure you make $1500.

Nowhere did it say you get an additional $1500 for completing 200 rides,"
SDSU,And the algo will purposefully give you all the long rides in the area. It a real trap.
SDSU,There IS a Lyft drivers sub...
SDSU,Wow! 200 rides. They’re smoking something good at LYFT hahaha back in the good old days that’s woulda been 120 rides for $1500 guarantee.
SDSU,"The whole ""it's for part time only"" is nothing more than a corporate technique for justifying low pay.

The reality is doing it part time does not magically make the pay better or more ethical.  The only thing part time might do for you is enable you  to be more picky about the rides you take and/or the hours you work-- if you have availability in your schedule.

In fact, if I have another full time job and my bills are paid, why would I ever get off my couch to go pick someone up at Walmart with a cart full of groceries for $3.75?  The idea of it is ridiculous in fact.  Who would ever do that?

The truth is though, the full timers are the ones who make the system work.  And full timers absolutely deserve a living wage.  Especially since our vehicles (""investment"") are often $20,000+."
SDSU,"Yeah I’m gonna have to look for something else. This shit is a joke, once you tally up the expenses and wear and tear on your vehicle it’s a money pit and the Lyft ceos are laughing their way to the bank."
SDSU,"Relying on Lyft as it’s a full time job is bad, but using it an addition with a full time job makes life pretty manageable with how expensive things are. Do Lyft/uber on a Saturday for 4-6 hours and you can easily make 300-500$, that’s my car payment for the month

People fucked up relying solely on rideshare for all their income"
SDSU,I’m not upset at all. If anything I’m really happy for you. Your decision to find a job other than do this is definitely a good decision for just about anyone. Both Uber and Lyft suck ass and treat both their drivers as well as passengers like shit. I wouldn’t be surprised if they treat their internal employees just as badly.
SDSU,"I've been driving for Uber for 6 years. I signed up for Lyft in Jan 2020, but only have about 700 rides total with them (13,250 rides with Uber) 

I have only ever done rideshare as a side gig. As I've progressed at my day job, I've driven less and less. Now I'm almost strictly weekends. When I started rideshare, my hours at my day job were not very consistent. I might work just a few days a week for 15 hours, or I could work 6 days in a row with 50+ hours. I would use rideshare to supplement the days I didn't work. It's also cyclical work where the cycles are opposing to rideshare. When one is busy, the other isn't. So this complimented my day job pretty well. 

I couldn't imagine if I had to rely on this for my sole income."
SDSU,"I already applied to UPS and am starting this week and am applying to other jobs. Gonna work 2 jobs instead of Uber and Lyft. I'm already working 120+ hrs, making about 12 dollars an hour or less after gas, etc.

If I put that many hours into any regular job I'd be making nearly double and about 1000 miles less added to my car weekly."
SDSU,Needed 10 rides today to complete my bonus and it ended up taking 5 hours. I went a whole hour without a single offer and that was around 1 pm. This shit ain’t sustainable for people doing this to make a living.
SDSU,I’ve only ever driven for Lyft part time and the only times I’ve either driven for Lyft is for the bonus streaks. I used to double dip in each of those bonus streaks and make $400-500 in one work day in just 6 hours. I never tried doing it full-time nor did I ever believe that Lyft was meant to be a full time job in general. The infrastructure of it is just built for earning extra side cash to pay a couple of bills. I’ve thought that I would be paying a $3000 mortgage by driving for Lyft. It’s just not feasible. 🤷🏽‍♀️
SDSU,"If you take out the cost of wear and tear on your vehicle, the maintenance, etc on an annualized basis it’s extremely difficult to justify using ride share as primary mode of income. The only ones that can potentially make a case of it being lucrative are those that drive black- but even that is an extreme hustle, and the ones that make it with black have a mix of ride share and private clients or cash clients…then maybe you can make some $…otherwise it’s all a scam. 

What’s even more appalling is that despite exploiting their drivers , and charging their customers 2-3x what they are paying drivers - both Uber and Lyft have yet to really show their shareholders any real financial gains. They are both operationally inefficient, with hundreds of millions of dollars flowing through their hands yet they are incapable of capturing enough of that flow to become profitable. 

At the end of the day, they both provide digital platforms that connect buyers and sellers …and still struggle. No one wins - drivers lose, customers lose, as do shareholders…that can’t be a sustainable model…"
SDSU,I wish you well with your new Job . You have done right my friend . I’ve been driving for Uber  and Lyft for nine years . I graduated this year with my Masters degree in occupational therapy . All I have to do is pass my board exam on next week Monday and I’m done driving full time for under and Lyft . It’s been along time coming but I’m so looking forward to a new rewarding career !
SDSU,How narcissistic of you to think anybody gives a shit about you quitting Lyft that you have to make a dramatic announcement 😱
SDSU,"Nah, I multi app and only drive lyft if they give good bonuses. The delivery side pays way better. Pax/delivery is my full time job. I work when I want and make over a grand a week. Is only kind of job I'd do now."
SDSU,Why do people have to announce they aren't going to drive rideshare anymore?
SDSU,Yea I agree ☝️.  Lyft still though is trying to pay too much.  They can literally offer $5 for 20 mile rides and see who stays and who does it.  Increase profitability
SDSU,Who would be mad that u say that? Lyft isn't worth. I drive for them when they give me a great deal.
SDSU,I think the calculus is simply flood the market with drivers looking to complete challenges and the company will end up paying less for surges and less to drivers overall.
SDSU,"Yes, want driver  to be online 12hrs/ day 7 day/week."
SDSU,This is wild!! 36 rides a day my friend
SDSU,I forgot to take a screenshot but the new weekly challenges for this coming week has an option for 170 rides 5am Monday to 5am Friday… with the 12 hour limit I have no idea how that’s possible
SDSU,Better than my market. $110 for 50 rides.
SDSU,"Mine is similar in a town of less than 100k, except the only one over $1/ride is the highest. 🙃"
SDSU,386 in Los Angeles for 145 rides wtf
SDSU,Once you realize that you are making an extra $2 a ride and gonna have to wait an extra 10min - 30min in between rides you quickly gonne finna find out it's not worth [it.lol](https://it.lol)
SDSU,"145 rides in 4 days is more than 36 rides per day - even with location filter on, this is pretty much impossible. 

Lyft knows it is impossible, which is why they make they offer. 

If they don’t know it is pretty nearly impossible, then they don’t know enough about the driver experience to be allowed to run such a company. My guess is a bit of both is at play. David Risher is dicking around with superficial, trivial brand differentiators (the airport ride bullshit they just released), meanwhile, the app sucks and Lyft seems to show zero interest in fixing the basic functions that annoy the shot out of passengers and drivers alike. 

Lyft needs to wtfu and get the basics down"
SDSU,"I got 95 rides for 335 
65 for 155 
And 55 for 95"
SDSU,"Dude wtf right? But damn I thought my offer was insane. They gave me $485 for 145 rides. 

As someone who drives both Uber and Lyft, this can be done. But you will have minimal sleep and literally no time for anything else. It’s especially more difficult because as you said - ATX dies down during the summer."
SDSU,"At least you're still getting challenges based on the number of rides taken. In Detroit the challenge is based on how much you make, and I think as a consequence the rides are paying way less than they did even a few weeks ago. I was on the road for almost an hour this morning before I found a ride that paid even $1/mile."
SDSU,"Better than mine, the challenge I have showing is 10 rides for 10 dollars, lol"
SDSU,"I have been driving for the last 12 hours thinking about this week’s challenge, and other thing I will point out, which is something I have figured out through 5 years of driving in Austin: 

The Austin market for Uber is SUBSTANTIALLY bigger than that of Lyft. If you want evidence of this just look at the airport queues for both platforms during heavy travel times. The ratio of Uber to Lyft drivers is at minimum 4:1, but I’ve seen it 5:1 and higher. 

As such, there are way less people driving Lyft compared to Uber, and if you’ve noticed like I have, Uber will say it’s supposed to be busy in certain areas (not to mention in Austin you can usually just tell it’s busy by the amount of traffic and activity downtown) but you’ll go several minutes if not longer waiting for a ride. In those same areas you can turn in the Lyft driving app and be bombarded with back to back requests most times. Yes, Lyfts per ride pay sucks in comparison to Uber but you’ll get more rides. I’ve also realized at the end of the week, with incentives, sometimes I’ll average a higher $/hour on Lyft, even though i seemingly got many more better paying rides in Uber. It all evens out in the end. 

Good luck this week! I’ll update here if I get anywhere close to 145 rides this coming week 😂"
SDSU,I just did 38 rides yesterday. I was taking only $2 rides.
SDSU,"Demand wasn't there for a 4 day challenge with the 12 hours on, 6 hours off rule. I managed to finish the 95 ride tier with 5 minutes to spare of online time the final day. Definitely exhausted. I'd love to have tiered challenges every week. It gamifies that weekly monetary goal. They just ran this again this month."
UT Austin,"Are you getting the emails for the Lyft credit? They send them out like every month and you have to add it to your account. It should be under the ""Promos"" tab in the Lyft app if it was added correctly. If it's there, double check that your pickup AND dropoff locations are in the correct zones. There's a different zone for pickup (pretty much just campus) and dropoff. If everything seems good, email nightrides@austin.utexas.edu, and they'll prob be able to help.

Here's the link to all the info: https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides"
UT Austin,"this might be obvious, but did you claim the lyft credits from the email that gets sent out every month and is the UT night rides pass showing up in the app?"
UT Austin,"You have to claim the promo credits like the other commenters said, and the email on your Lyft account has to be the same email associated with your UT profile (whether that's your @utexas.edu or your personal email account)."
UT Austin,no it’s been a thing for a long time. every month you get $100 in ride credits every month but it’s only valid in designated locations and at certain hours
UT Austin,"it was instituted after that girl got murdered on campus, except when they started it was unlimited rides 

good to see UT is decreasing the safety budget for students 🤘🏻"
UT Austin,Is there any reason they don’t just give $100 credit? Do they have to prepay Lyft? If so then they don’t have anything to lose just giving credits. Or does UT receive credit back for unused rides
UT Austin,are you sure you’re booking the ride while on campus and the destination is in an approved area?
UT Austin,"keeps happening to me too :( let me know if you figure out what’s going on

fyi on my friends’ phones they don’t see a price, they just see the word FREE. so if it ends up working that’s what you’ll see before you book the ride!"
UT Austin,"When you go to book a ride, it crosses out the price and shows up as ‘FREE.’ Atleast it should. Maybe you haven’t loaded the Lyft pass into your account. Or you can email the UT rides email."
UT Austin,I think you must also book the ride between the times 12am-4am if you haven’t been doing so already.
UT Austin,"Check this out https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides

If you follow this, your account should be reloaded every month with $100 Lyft Pass"
UT Austin,"I believe this is part of the UT Night Rides initiative, in which case see [here](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides) for those stipulations (i.e. from main campus from midnight to 4 A.M.), but otherwise it's legit."
UT Austin,"There is no downside, per say. You receive $100 credit every month and it only works from 11pm-4am. You have to be on certain areas by UT too. There's a helpful map/guide once you accept it under the Lyft sidebar explaining it better. 

The areas it covers range from Riverside to North Campus to East Campus to Wampus to Far West"
UT Austin,"AFAIK, it's for night rides only. [https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides)"
UT Austin,"Yes, you can use it to go to 6th, but you have to choose a location in the pink on this site: https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides

Also, you can only use it to leave campus after midnight"
UT Austin,"If you haven’t already, consider looking into the [UT night rides](https://parking.utexas.edu/ut-night-rides) provided by Lyft. They cover most off campus areas where students typically live (see website for map of coverage)."
UT Austin,"Buses are fine, don’t worry about it. UT Night Rides will help you a lot, but only in certain neighborhoods.

Maybe get a bike/e-bike/scooter?"
UT Austin,"if you live within the boundary (all the way up to hyde park) you can use [sure walk](https://parking.utexas.edu/transportation/walking)! i'm not sure if there has been any changes since i last used it, but it's a free rideshare by ut to take you anywhere on ut campus to off campus between 8pm and 2am"
UT Austin,"Yes, and there are also still cabs lined up if the Lyft doesn’t show for some reason."
UT Austin,"If she can’t find the pick-up location for ride shares, tell her to just follow the literal graveyard of luggage wheel remains. The broken wheels will lead her to the numbered pillars where she can wait for her ride, which shouldn’t be too long a wait.

(Warn her that it is the bumpiest, longest, stupidest walk ever. & the little shuttle that they offer barely helps, so don’t even bother with it. Every time we drag our suitcases down the wheel graveyard to hail a ride, I can’t help but wonder if the concrete was deliberately made to destroy luggage. Did Samsonite sponsor the construction or something? It’s embarrassing.)"
UT Austin,Cabs are about the same as Lyft or Uber these days and you don’t have to call ahead or wait.
UT Austin,The trick is to take the bus to an off airport location then have Lyft take them the rest of the way.
UT Austin,"It'll cost you, and as a woman I find that Lyft drivers are consistently weirder than Uber ones, so if she's sensitive about having a weird time Uber is the better (though not guaranteed perfect) bet."
UT Austin,"Depending on where you're going, the #20 Cap Metro bus can be a better option. It's quick to get to downtown, UT, or parts of central Austin. I used Lyft/Uber once instead and it was a much longer walk and just more of a hassle."
UT Austin,Plenty of taxis and ride shares are available. Let her know they are located in the garage and to follow signs to the location. It is a schlep.
UT Austin,"Yes, there is a designated area for ride share pickups now."
Auburn,So I would look at the time that they apply. I used to think it was for rides during any time but I think during the week it’s from around 7-9pm or something silly
Auburn,"Good to hear. I only do early mornings now till NYSE opens on the day. Got too tired of DT being a pick-up clusterfuck. Hope you made a killin! Surge looked pretty heavy all night. 

If anything will help the whole power bill situation, it’s making good money. Get after it, tonight and tomorrow will be even better. Not sure how well you know the area but home game Friday’s have the best tippers out by 85. Not as great as just accepting every short ride DT but I’ve been able to make some great connections with some insanely successful people. Does wonders for honing networking and social skills too. 

Those who grind for their living gotta watch out for eachother. Stay hungry and make you that cash money. Auburn rewards those who take advantage of gameday and brave the FOMO. 

Stay safe out there!"
Auburn,Mad respect to the Uber drivers. Fuck anyone who gives any type of slack to an Uber driver.
Auburn,Something tells me the type of people needing an Uber home at 2am are not the type of people to read and careful consider other’s opinions on the subreddit xD
Auburn,"Drunk students are rude.  My kid did Lyft when he was a student at Auburn, he could swap some stories with you!!!"
Auburn,"Minus the rideshare aspect, I’m a student currently and just going on campus is rough some days. Like people will literally walk all over you, bump you, push you, and then get mad at YOU. 🥴 And there’s always been a sense of entitlement from some but man has it seemed to have gotten so much worse."
Auburn,Yeah I know what you mean but in a different way. I can’t imagine what it’s like being a Uber driver (or any other ride system) but you sound genuine. I’m sorry for your experiences but yeah it’s not just you if it makes you feel less alone. I’m a student myself right now (a junior currently) and I’m 20- I def feel the attitudes and vibe just change to more hostile around students who came last year and this year. Not to say my class wasn’t rude cuz there def are people that were rude but it just seems like even more. I’m sure having more freedom now is making people want to do whatever they want but I still can’t understand the rude behavior. All I wanted was to get out of my parents house too but I can’t imagine doing something like that to my Uber driver 💀
Auburn,"I saw a drunk woman arguing with a taxi driver, she kept yelling about how she couldn’t find her keys and he just wanted to get paid. It was clear She felt like if she played damsel in distress she could get out of paying and it was just hard to watch."
Auburn,What does the ride-share situation look like?  I know it’s a college town but I feel like there are some places that can still be hit or miss as far as that goes.
Auburn,Your looking at a 30+ mile Uber even if they were out there.
Auburn,"Shit parking on most of campus, downtown parking is getting worse, explosive population expansion, and a lot of construction. 

To counter the first two, it’s not wildly expensive to live close enough to walk to class within about 30 minutes and the bus is *typically* pretty good for the father apartment complexes, Uber and Lyft are usually $8-$16 downtown if you live remotely near campus."
Auburn,"Could see if there are any restaurant jobs available for night or weekend shifts. Or gig work like uber, doordash, etc. if you want to set your own hours"
Auburn,My youngest drove for Lyft and was able to set his own hours. It might work for you.
Auburn,"Easiest thing would be to use that new truck to Uber or Lyft a few nights a week, Thursday - Saturday, work until you hit your number and sign off. Could also do the instacart shopping thing. Beyond that you could work a couple evenings in restaurants, but that isn’t easy and you would be on your feet most likely, same with grocery stores."
George Washington,"It’s truly a good community. I was never on the vern but I always hear amazing stories of how the connections made are fruitful and quality. I know many that were happy about it and also GW tries as hard as they can to promote the vern so there are tons of events with free food and activities. Also, ngl the nighttime free Lyfts back to the vern is kinda a flex. 

It’s the best way to have a proper college experience with a big outdoor campus and all the amenities you need."
George Washington,"You might not stay friends with the people you meet on the vern freshman year, but you will immediately and forever click with anyone who lived on the vern at some point. Alum, upperclassmen, whoever. You can use the vex as an excuse for being late as it is, in fact, ALWAYS running late. It’s a quiet campus if you are into that (I wasn’t, but midterms and finals hit you really hard, and it’s nice to come home and force yourself to be… home). If you live in west, that building is pretty good (facilities are super accessible). If you don’t, you get to dunk on the west hall kids who do kinda have it better (west hall best hall but like it IS an unfair deal if you’re on the hillsides). Lyfts are helpful… to an extent. You can be your buddies lyft pass as well, so its way easier to have late night hang outs now than it used to be. Otherwise make of it what you will. There’s a lot of downsides but you find what you love about it in your time. And then coming to campus is even better (plus you know how to budget better)."
George Washington,"The Vern campus wise is very nice. It’s near some restaurants and a small town, which sometimes has flea markets. Also I’ve known some individuals who were able to get pet sitting, dog walking and babysitting jobs in the past. 
However, in my opinion the best part of the Vern is the Lyft pass. After midnight you can get a Lyft back to the Vern if you are out (which is really nice as you get to skip the hassle of getting back to your dorm) and on Saturday there is a pass to get to the shoppers which is lovely as it makes it easy to get groceries back!"
George Washington,"Any NYC trip from our area is undoable anymore. On Friday night, I was offered a mere $74 to drive from NE Philly to Coney Island of all places which would've been a 2.5+ hour trip one way with over $40 in tolls. A year ago, if I didn't want to deal with multiple rides or if it was a slower night, I would've EASILY accepted the trip because it would've paid close to double. And I can work all of NJ so I could do rides on the way back if I wanted, despite being very inconsistent. I'm a driver who used to love the longer trips but I can't do the majority of them anymore solely based on pay alone."
George Washington,"That's insane. When I first started driving for Uber 4 years ago the regional rail line was down. So people were taking Ubers from Philadelphia to NY. I got paid 206 for the ride and a 100 dollar tip. 

Tip aside a trip that far should be at least 150 dollars. That's fucked up."
George Washington,I dont do rides longer then 45 minutes and i will only do it if it pays minimum $35. And i dont do any rides that are less then $8. Because anything else its not worth driving for.
George Washington,Took similar ride with lux but to Newark airport from there.  Paid 220
George Washington,Haha.  Reminds me of when Lyft offered me $60 to drive someone from Sacramento to Fresno.  Just enough to cover gas! What a joke.
George Washington,I would not have taken this ride. Periodt.
George Washington,"Literally 99 percent of rides from the suburbs such as CT, NJ, and middle to eastern Long Island to nyc/ or the three major airports is not worth it to drivers in those markets time and moneywise, between the massive cost in tolls/ dead heading back with no chance to make any money on the way back you’d have to a complete moron to take those rides. And that’s not even factoring in the terrible road conditions, traffic, red light and speeding cameras every half fucking mile, the bike lanes and other bullshit, fuck the city….I lived in nyc for 36 years I’m glad I got the fuck out in time"
George Washington,The other day I picked up a pax in Princeton going to Brooklyn ended up being $89 for the ride plus a $5 bonus.
George Washington,Im not a driver but I would think that the new manhattan congestion fees would be a killer
George Washington,The rides coming from nyc TCL license drivers going out of ny are good pay but coming back the raters suck
George Washington,"I swear you guys photoshop this shit lol. I live in New jersey, gave a ride from cape may to union yesterday and got paid $220. Ive never seen rates this low"
George Washington,I’ve been stuck in this Lyft rental program for a month slaving away and it helped me out because I was out of a car but they pay you less when using the rental. I struggled to make the payment. I’m just now getting out of it
George Washington,"Rental programs are a joke and predatory, nothing new

Most markets you want the ability to use Uber and Lyft, but with rentals, you can't."
George Washington,"I asked about this yesterday but IMO the only viable reason to rent a car is if your car is in the shop needing repairs or as in my case, I was thinking of doing it just to test the waters of doing Lyft/Uber type driving but don’t currently have a qualifying vehicle to do it. Mainly in order to see if I like doing it and test the waters of my area before buying a used car."
George Washington,"Just sharing my two cents here with the Lyft express drive: i just got out of it today, it was a month and a half of mixed feelings with the car. I got better tips and i worked pretty much every day for 10 hours. Yes, gas took away a good chunk but I got enough to pay my bills and stay afloat while looking for another car and another job. I got those last week. For me it worked out okay but the fees are ridiculously high and gas prices are no help either. Ponder your options if you are out of a car and need one. But you really gotta get out of it quickly and get a steady income besides Lyft."
George Washington,"Per mile and per minute rate is less with a rental then it is normally! Do not rent from Lyft , modern day slavery"
George Washington,"Hey that's crazy I LITERALLY been waiting for one of these posts to pop up for like 2 weeks now , so I was driving for Lyft for a month I was homeless my older cousin helped me get the deposit and helped me get a bank account , I had a electric car a kira Niro Ev 2023 the first few weeks was cool and chill I wasn't really bothered by nobody for perspective (I'm black 25 with 1 daughter in my life a newborn to be exact) so you can imagine nothing really bothers me from arguing amongst riders people eating in the car people tryna flirt with you ( both female and male) 
It wasn't till maybe the month mark I started noticing little things like for one my weekly rental fee supposed to be 330 nothing higher or more that's with the insurance and fees they said man I noticed I been getting 487 weekly rental charges weekly and then I noticed the toll of driving all day and night then driving back home  I would drive in Sacramento all over to the valley and Santa Cruz but nobody told me that for one that there's no evcs chargers down the central valley area as far as level 3 and up be lucky there's a level 2 around , then the slow days I gotten so many slow days in the valley I never drove in Stockton for the reason of a bad experience of almost getting shot during a ride , like I literally had to either sleep in the car for the weekdays to actually have energy to drive to Sacramento  then drive back home , I wasn't eating cause I wouldn't make enough money it was just so many variables and Lyft was just no help at all I was a pure t star driver not one single low review or none of that platinum driver and what Lyft do leave out vital information I learned to only drive for Lyft and Uber with your own car or have a job on top before even driving Lyft cause those fees are ridiculous but on the bright side of you get in a accident in they car you can always get you a new one as long as it wasn't your fault"
George Washington,"I rent a car and pocket about 800-1000 after rental fee and gas per week driving 6 days 8-10 hours. I live in a big city. Personally this is enough to live on and save quite a bit too. The money is there if you put the time in, but the hours could bother some people. Lyft barely feels like work to me so I'm able to easily grind the 50-60 hours per week without burnout."
George Washington,"I crashed their shit car, didn't even pay the 500 deductible, still let me drive for them in the new whip before completely quiting shit exploitative ride share gigs"
George Washington,"Got a rental as my car was hit by a DD while I slept. 

My area flexdrive just bought a ton of hybrids 2023. I got one. Had 7 miles on it when I picked it up. I get about 50 mpg and fill up every 2 days of driving vs everyday in my personal vehicle. 

It is 300 a week towards the rental and fees but I am going to get reimbursed on that from either my insurance or the DDs insurance. (DD insurance is trying to claim the driver was not insured.)

But yeah the rates are lower. But the gas is much better. 30 bucks every 2 days. 

You have to put on miles for it to be worth it."
George Washington,Rented for a year loved and hated it never had a problem until my car broke down. Hertz billed me for the world and claims I still owe $150 today. They don’t care about anyone lyft nor hertz will help me. So I’m done with the both of them forever…
George Washington,I drove my own vehicle- a 2020 Chevy Traverse for a couple months last year for Uber and Lyft. An 8-passenger car supposedly gets the premium rate per trip. I was shocked at the low payouts I was getting daily versus the mileage and wear on my vehicle so I quit. Turns out the Detroit (mine) and San Francisco markets have the 2 lowest payout rates in the nation. Fucking ripoff.
George Washington,Renting is easy for me because I can actually make $300 a day but only on Mondays....For some reason it's more profitable. I don't have to worry about maintenance..All I have to do is put gas and keep it clean...You have to grind I'm already into making my money. Plus I drive a M7 series Beamer I can protect my investment by keeping my mileage down... To each its own....I still can make at least about $1k a week....What y'all doing? I know Lyft plays games but I only do rides that makes sense time wise and money wise....Maybe not look for big long trips...I take short to somewhat medium rides
George Washington,"Lyft, Uber or whoever the fuck else is in business for one reason to make a profit.  They don't give a fat babies ass except for their bottom line.  The fact that these COCKSUCKERS can get away with taking almost 2/3rds of the fare is outrageous.  It wasn't like that when it started but now that so many people are out of work the gig economy is overflowing with people which allows them to fuck all of us with a soft dick.  This is the way of the world. They also know that the majority of the people who drive for them don't have the necessary degrees to do anything better.  Now degrees don't equate to intelligence it's nothing more than a passport to get your foot in the building with still no guarantee for a job.  It also doesn't help that this country is a corporation run by corporations.  For instance look what happened recently in Illinois(correct me if I'm wrong), where the Governor who was clearly bought By Uber vetoed a bill that would made drivers employee's and not contractors. If this would have passed it would have created a snowball affect to other states and cities. So don't ever expect a company like Uber who made a net profit of over 14 billion to give a fuck about us...14 billion dollars and all they are is nothing more than a match making app for car services."
George Washington,"It’s not for everyone or every market. I managed to pay my 260 every weekend in two days over the span of 6 hrs each day. The rest of the week was gravy. I could do more rides or a regular job/side hustle. $10 of gas got me $200 in rides or other. You think your own car will be any better? Let’s say $500 for your car payment…$200 for your insurance. Gas…. Then incidentals like new tires…. Maintenance… it’s the same shit just how you pay for it. You pay 1000 a month but don’t have to also save half of your income incase shit happens to your car. Tires all four will be $800 upfront. With the rental you pay for the rental that week not $800. There are pros and cons and If you hustle it’s doable if you don’t like hustling and choosing what days you do what and when…then yes the rental is not for you. Your market can suck also making the rental a bad move too, but it also isn’t a bad move for everyone. 

It’s not for you if you have a car with a car payment. 
It’s not for you if your market sucks ass
It’s not for you if you can afford and are capable of getting a car financed. 
It’s not for you if you aren’t structured in your work."
George Washington,Big scam i grinded a month upgraded to Tesla rental to save on gas i was doing $80 gas daily driving 12hrs online time. if you don’t plan to drive 7 days a week 9-12 hrs you will find yourself in a big financial hole also with hertz rental thru Uber. Thankfully i stopped. Did school full time got nice financial aid check nd put that down on a 2021 Prius prime now I’m back driving lyft nd It’s worth it.
George Washington,Reminds me of predatory yellow cab practices. Except those drivers were forced to borrow up to $100K and basically be enslaved for decades to pay it off. At least you can get out of this one in a month.
George Washington,AGREED!  I’m in the hole with Lyft due to the ridiculous electric car rental they offered.  I was given rides as low as $2.30 and hardly ever received anything over $10….you literally work 24/7 and pay them an astronomical amount for the rental AND you are required to meet their minimum amount of drives also for the week.  Your literally working for them to increase their earnings and we get screwed!!
George Washington,i do not understand why anyone would choose this model unless lyft was their full-time job though. i make 400 a day but thats only with this as my main. i can’t survive with this as a side hustle
George Washington,"The rental program is really for full times drivers who average about 100-135 trips a week and make at least 1000-1500 a week.

Only way u can win otherwise is if you have other main sources of income. And u use Lyft to avoid putting miles on your car"
George Washington,"A heard about ""Ryde""  a decentralized  driver owned network, I hope they launch soon https://ryde.tech/"
George Washington,"Unfortunately Lyft and Uber have become modern day slavery, with no real intervention from the law they are literally paying about $7-8 per hour once you factor ALL the expenses plus taxes, McDonalds its a better option at this point  with the way they’re flat out taking 80% of what customers pay is just doesn’t make sense to do it at all"
George Washington,If anyone rents from left they are really stupid.   Look. If you don’t have a car then rideshare isn’t for you.   People are stupid
George Washington,Just went through this. It was easy. Everything was deductible. I owed $2 nd the filing fee for the $11k i generated in 3 months. 9k income. Worked rideshare for those 3 month yes. $2 dollars.
George Washington,Just keep on slaving until you can pay the minimum down payment for your own car. Then you won't be renting from Lyft and you'll get away from Lyft slavery and join in Grub hub Uber and other Slave apps.🥰 Keep stacking up and use the saving option in the Lyft Direct app of need be.
George Washington,I’ve been doing it for over a year. I have my reasons but honestly I make enough driving Uber and playing poker to cover the fee every week. They recently started requiring 20 rides per week which I’ll do when they offer a bonus and it cuts down the rental fee a bit.
George Washington,It's all part of the Lyft experience. Embrace the suck!   Lol
George Washington,Why not rent a car from somewhere else? Im not a lyft driver jw
George Washington,"I drive a rental and just started with Lyft. I stay outside Chicago, but went downtown and around lakeshore area. I’ve already made, more than my rental, within 3 days…maybe just focus on, making the rental first and then, do more rides, so you can have more money yourself. You signed up for the rental and knew, what came with it. I’d rather pay for a rental, than have all that damage/wear and tear, on my vehicle. Nothing wrong with, renting a car through Lyft"
George Washington,I was just talking to driver the other day and mentioned I might try driving with the Lyft and she mentioned this program. Definitely glad I read this post before signing up.
George Washington,All facts. I practically lived in my rental with Lyft. Ugh. But I ended up buying my own car.
George Washington,"I remember renting a few years back, they did note that people who rent with their express program do get paid less from their fares. And then a few months later they would even pay the express rental drivers even less when they updated the pricing.
This was when their cars was 274 a week. Excluding the 200 deposit."
George Washington,"Guys you have to put in the numbers different to see the whole figure in the end. 
The Lyft rental is now: 
$280      A WEEK
$1120     A MONTH
$13,340 A YEAR

Now think about…you buy for example a new Toyota Corolla Hybrid. On the Toyota Homepage this car cost you: 

Fair credit score of 650

48 Months finance

George Washington,"Yeah currently in this situation, 361 a week for the rental. Plus gas. But I need a car, and they make so much off you doing this! They even pay less per ride when you have one of the hertz vehicles!"
George Washington,In nyc I used have rideshare companies pay the tolls to pick up customer in Staten Island and bring them back to Brooklyn or Manhattan.  But now Lyft and Uber state they only reimburse drivers when the rider is in the car and is going through a bridge or tunnel with a toll.  Before they used to push the cost to the customer if there was a toll so a driver can reach them and pick them up but I guess they got some backlash from customers not willing to pay for tolls when they aren’t in the car which only extends wait time and creates surges during peak time in Staten Island
George Washington,I drove about a month ago went through two tolls and they only paid me 1/2 of what I paid. Then I had to pay them to get home or take back roads adding two hours. Lyft is getting very tight and cheating drivers.
George Washington,"After driving with them, I no longer ride with the. Since I don't really tip for rides as I can't afford it (I'm sorry, but rich clients who have serious money have repeatedly not tipped me, these are the people who can and should tip), I ride with uber where at least know the driver is not being offered 1 to 3 dollars for the ride.."
George Washington,I’m done with LYFT the Garden State Parkway was the only way to go from Rochelle Park to Irvington $2.02 at the toll not included in the upfront price!!! I will delete this trash 🗑️ app
George Washington,"They don't have to pay for tolls, as long as drivers still drives for them knowing the information."
George Washington,I was faithful in doing Lyft and got shafted they can definitely kiss 💋 where the sun 🌞 doesn't shine.
George Washington,"I have a problem with Lyft, I drive in the Philly area and sometimes I have to take passengers to nj. There’s a five dollar toll to come back into PA so whenever I take someone to jersey Lyft has never paid for the toll to come back. Not to mention that PA Lyft drivers can’t drive in jersey so I get logged out of the app anyways"
George Washington,"Worst support in the entire world. I contacted them once about a toll for a ride because they paid me lower than the amount that was charged and support would not reimburse the 75¢ difference unless I had a receipt. I told them multiple times that the toll station did not give a receipt and showed them the charge on my credit card but they didn’t care. Uber happily reimburses the correct toll amount, so I don’t know why Lyft can’t. Is Lyft severely broke or something? Lmao"
George Washington,"I have found that Gr**yft** often does omit the tolls.  If I protest, it will add the toll.  I suspect that this is deliberate in hopes that many drivers will not notice it.  If you protest, it will pay, but, it relies on large numbers of drivers' not protesting.  If one hundred drivers say nothing about a five dollar toll, that has to be close to two months electric bill at one of the few Hubs that is still open."
George Washington,I had rides in NJ and sometimes they would reimburse you for tolls and sometimes they wont. Lyft is such a scam they take 50%+ for rides sometimes even more if its a priority ride. Lyft sometimes would take 70-80% on some of the long rides as well. This company is a joke. We make Logan Green super rich while he sits on his ass and does absolutely nothing. Except making decisions on how to make more money and screw Lyft drivers over. I heard drivers getting murdered out there for $12 an hour after expenses and all Lyft does says we are sorry for your loss. Company is a joke. Thank god i do this part time. I feel bad for those who drive Lyft full time.
George Washington,I’m mainly Uber but I did drive Lyft in Philly for the Eagle’s playoffs . because Uber sent me out there but Lyft let me do pickups
George Washington,In MA  They snitch on drivers so the state adds an extra dollar to every toll
George Washington,Yea they do unless driver specifies not to take toll and you do. The route will not take you on till in that case. They do not pay for express lanes though and they will tell you to take them. Which is pure bs
George Washington,"I recently had like 10$ in tolls on an hour long trip, (I usually drive Lyft 95 percent of the time). Anyways , Uber included like 1$ for toll on the fare , I reached out, and needless to say Uber was generous in making it right . Also had a psssnger make a mess recently w Uber, submitted a detailing invoice from a shop, Uber instantly covered it.
HOWEVER, when I asked lyft to cover a toll, they wouldn’t. Also submitted an invoice for a mess and they wouldn’t pay more than 20$ that they originally provided .. smh . Prob from all these bonusss they’re tapped, like here, take this money and leave us alone for anything else 😂"
George Washington,"If the base allows uber/lyft/taxis to go in and pick up pax, they will let you know at the gate and the pax should already know if they need to alert the gate.  If the base is 100% off limits, the pax should know this and know to meet you at the gate."
George Washington,"Go to the base visitors center and see if they offer badges or access for lyft and uber, some do this and will give you a contractor badge to access the bases.  The base where I'm at does this for both and for taxi's."
George Washington,If you have a passenger being dropped off on base and they have a military id you can get through the gate with that and your drivers license. As far as picking up is concerned just cancel as they will waste your time before allowing you to leave the gate.
Louisville,"Something you may not have considered if you’re looking to cut down your transportation costs, I always take a TARC into town and Uber home."
Louisville,"I drove Uber before the pandemic. Did it in a fullsize pickup to get us through about 3-4mo of a cash crunch as I changed jobs and we had a huge dip in income we weren't ready for.

Let me be 100% clear. It's BARELY a profitable job. You are trading your time and equity in your vehicle for cash in hand. The only way it works out where you make money is if you ignore the cost of purchase and insurance. If you negate those (because you already have the vehicle, and will have those expenses regardless of working), then I made \~$13-$15/hr. With places now hiring in that range for NOT driving, Uber becomes far less of a good deal. The only upside IMO is that you can log in/out as you see fit, and you don't have to adhere to a given schedule. 

 I only drove Fri-Sat-Sun nights from \~5pm to \~5am or so. Family was mostly sleeping or otherwise preocupied, so I was out making cash to keep the lights on while they slept. It worked for me, as I needed cashflow, not pure profits while I transitioned career positions.

If you're OK trading your time and vehicle for cashflow, sure it can work. If you want pure profits, it's not great. Let me know if you want more details, or a peek at my records for driving."
Louisville,"Uber and Lyft you would be driving one or two people around, getting paid next to nothing after gas costs"
Louisville,"You’d be better off paying a friend or family member gas money to take you, or renting a car. It’s unlikely a driver would even take the ride since they most likely would not make money on the way back."
Louisville,Are you asking how much the driver would make or how much you would pay?
Louisville,"In the chances someone won't take you the full trip and you absolutely need to use a ride share service, I'd suggest booking a trip about halfway there and and then getting a second lyft to reach the actual destination."
Louisville,Prices are supply/demand based at the time of request and can vary wildly.  Rides to airports are usually more expensive.
Louisville,"Why does Uber spam job boards advertising positions for teachers and professors, and all sorts of other occupations, then put the relevant info about looking for drivers further in the listing?"
Louisville,"A couple of things, information-wise:

Lyft has now updated their coverage map. A few weeks ago they took a giant slice out of the map, intending to just cut out the airport. Essentially, though, it cut out like probably 1/12 of the coverage area. they have now updated the map so that only the airport and a miniscule strip next to it is blocked. Lyft is still not allowed to pick up from the airport (drop-offs are fine), but if you are in that strip and need a ride, move the pin and text your driver the real address. Do not do this for the airport, we will be fined $100 if we are caught.

Also, Uber IS now allowing drivers to pick up from the airport. We may be fined, but Uber will now pay it!

Edit: I found out yesterday that the info I was given about uber being allowed to pick up from the airport was faulty. Please don't request from there until Uber/Lyft release statements saying that we can!"
Louisville,"Do you all see a significant down trend in service in and around major holidays? I'm an economics student, so we like to examine things like this. I know that shock pricing is something Uber and Lyft use, but is there a significant decrease during those times, or is it steady?

Also, thanks for the man rides home from 4th Street and Bardstown Road. I just hope I've been entertaining in my drunken ramblings to you. "
Louisville,"Hey rideshare folks. I've been driving a taxi for about 7 years with great success and I welcome new competition. I do want to clear some things up, though, and hopefully contribute to the discussion in a positive way.

The controversy with Louisville International Airport exists because LIA *insists* on contracts and permits for all commercial transit operating out of the airport. Given that Lyft and Uber are both companies that pick up for pay at the airport, both companies should be subject to follow the letter of the law. It's not an unfair barrier to competition, as some people have tried to spin it. It's the way the airport's management works, and it will probably be resolved in 2015. I dislike them as much as anybody else, but it is what it is.

As for the existence of ridesharing companies, it seems kind of unusual to me that a vehicle which is dispatched to a location and paid by a third party who handles money would not be considered a taxi, even though said vehicle and driver performs essentially the same services. Again, I'm not knocking competition - it was badly needed to begin with - but it seems that both Uber and Lyft operate on models that ignore laws completely that pertain to the services they offer. You guys should at the very least be required to pay for Ground Transportation permits with the city and be subject to the same fees and vehicle inspections that taxi and limousine services are obligated to pay and fulfill. 

I hope I didn't come across as nasty. I actually considered working for either company myself, but I wanted to be able to keep driving my cab as well. For whatever reason, Lyft doesn't want to have vehicles markedly identifiable as taxis working with them, and Uber isn't offering UberTaxi here. No clue what's up with that. 

The vast majority of our fleet drivers have abandoned Yellow Cab and switched to Uber, as far as I can tell. Our numbers have significantly reduced and our lease rates have increased. It's not necessarily taxi drivers who have dug their heels in so much as the company, whom I wish had the foresight to lobby for UberTaxi in the first place instead of throwing money at state government for regulations that do little to nothing. However, I still manage to make between $600-$1000 a week depending on how hard I want to work and what's going on in town. In the long run - especially in the summer - I don't see very many Uber or Lyft drivers making enough money to make it a full time job, which is kind of disappointing. It's a great model, but the insurance snafus are enough to make me stay away. I prefer to transport regular clients and build a relationship with them and know that they're covered if we get in an accident.

Just out of curiosity though - and this is one of the things that stopped me from working for y'all - does your personal insurance carrier continue to cover you if they find out you were operating for Uber or Lyft in the case of a collision?"
Louisville,Would you rather Lyft one elephant-sized puppy or a hundred puppy-sized elephants?
Louisville,"OP (Adam), you live on my street. Pretty cool. I tried out for Lyft but was denied because I didn't have floor mats and there is an old oil spot that *will not come out no matter what* in the backseat. Oh well."
Louisville,"What would you say is the income difference from lyfting in May 2014 versus now?

I say this, because I was making about $40 an hour back in May and then around July all the free promos stopped, and ride prices decreased. This led less people to request lyfts, and paired with the fact that more and more drivers were added daily, it became scarse to get more than 1 lyft an hour. I quit being a lyft mentor (rip position) around July 2014 because it just wasn't worth my time and effort to make barely minimum wage."
Louisville,"I have been curious about this, are Lyft and Uber drivers allowed to pick up me and my dog? Would it be the driver's preference?

I assume service animals must be allowed?

Just curious!"
Louisville,"Got an Uber to Cincinnati about a year ago for about $120-$130 from the Louisville Greyhound station after my bus was canceled at the last minute.. and already had paid for concert tickets that night, and a hotel reservation and of course didn't want to miss the concert.. I know we lucked out, but I contacted Uber and within literally 5 minutes one showed up and took us straight to our hotel in Cincy. I was still getting a refund on my Greyhound ticket when they showed up that fast .. When the driver got to Greyhound station, he asked where we're going even though I had entered Cincy as my destination . I said Cincinnati. He seemed surprised but just said okay and we were on our way. So we got dropped off at our hotel as opposed to having to find our way from the Greyhound station in Cincinnati. I was surprised it was that inexpensive for that one way trip.. I can't say how much they would charge you now.. Of course we gave them a generous  tip. Split the charge with my buddy so even though we had to pay extra at least we made the concert. If this had been a few years ago before Uber or Lyft we would have been fucked. I would imagine it would cost more now but at least we had that option and it really saved the day all things considered."
Louisville,The driver will have to drive home all those miles empty as they probably can't drive in another market. Consider a sizeable tip.
Louisville,"Had a coworker that managed to get an Uber to Indy last year, cost about $150 + generous tip.

He was in for meetings and a wave of flight cancellations was going to strand him for a few days, booked another flight ASAP and got a pickup from SDF straight to IND.

Alternatively, you might find someone on the sub that would be up for an adventure!"
Louisville,"I’m not a driver, but I’ve had a driver tell me to request the ride in advance because they can see the pick up and drop off. I do not know this for certain.  

When I request long hauls last min I always text the driver who accepts so they can cancel if they do not want to do a longer ride."
Louisville,I’m a driver. Chat request sent.
Louisville,"Hi! I just read your post as I was searching for the exact same thing. Would you mind sharing how you decided to make it to Indy and how much it cost? I have to catch a flight up there, but I live in Louisville. No direct flights from here for the times I needed, ugh. I've heard people paying drivers cash but I don't know how safe that would be you know? Everything is so expensive!!"
Louisville,"Depends on what part of town. The more urban areas, airport, downtown, highlands etc it’s pretty well served, further out you’ll find it takes a bit longer to get rides."
Louisville,"Between their shenanigans and Covid, drivership is way down everywhere except the big cities. You won’t have to trouble finding a ride most of the time, but you might late at night, etc."
Louisville,"Lyft/Uber isn’t how it once was, but I have had plenty of good experiences with taxis in this city"
Louisville,I've never had a problem getting an Uber or Lyft. Normally it's only about a 10 minute wait. If you are going to be in a less populated area it may take up to 30 minutes though.
Louisville,"Yes but be aware the lyfts/ubers are stationed at a separate parking lot (not too far from normal passenger pickup — if you’re coming down the escalator, towards the left)."
Louisville,"As long as there are flights coming in, there are ride share drivers available. While you are waiting for your bags to come out on the belt, request your ride. Neither of you (you or the driver) will have much of a wait if you do it then."
Louisville,"I used Uber on Halloween (well, Saturday actually) and got picked up on 6th Street within 5 minutes as late as 3:30 a.m. There was a bit of surge pricing around midnight. Can’t speak for how New Year’s will be but just sharing my experience."
Louisville,I just got an Uber at about midnight. $57 from the airport to J Town though.
Louisville,Left bar Halloween night at 3 am. Uber picked me up within 4 minutes. Was off main st downtown.
Louisville,"I work in a hotel and I can say without a doubt, no. Had issues this past Sunday because it was Halloween. They would not schedule my guest a ride because the demand was so high. I would imagine it's gonna be even worse for New Year's Eve."
Louisville,"It’ll be pretty expensive and There might be longer wait times, but if you’re willing to pay the surge pricing and wait for a ride you should be able to get some thing."
Louisville,I’ve caught of rides around 2am. The area is a favorite. If your inside the 264 loop it shouldn’t be a problem.
Louisville,Nope... scheduled a Uber 3 days in advance to drop me off at the airport and they cancelled 2 hours before my flight.
Louisville,"Funny. From like Feb to May I drove a taxi, and I might've seen one or two at night, but I usually never saw an uber or lyft till like 6/7am. Some nights I thought I was the only taxi out."
Louisville,"I have used Lyft a few times, and it has been a positive experience each time. I cannot say the same for cab rides. My biggest gripe is the ""My credit card machine is broken"" excuse from the big name cab companies. I do not carry cash, and I try to use those specific cabs because I know they can process a credit card.

However, I normally use [City Scoot.](http://www.cityscoot.com/) I cannot praise City Scoot enough. They are always very friendly and professional."
Louisville,"I have used Lyft numerous times and have gotten all different types of drivers.  Some where chatty, some were not -- I didn't care.  The service was good and I got home safely.  I would highly recommend!"
Louisville,I've used lyft several times... been great everytime
Louisville,"CityScoot is the best thing ever. 

During the daytime the cab situation here is great but at night time it can get sketchy and unreliable. I've had a ride or two where I questioned whether I was in a legit cab or not despite having called a dispatch. I've had friends from out of town visiting who got driven halfway around the city to increase the fare.

2/3 UberXLouisville experiences were good while 1 was so terrible I won't be using UberX any more. I've used Uber black when traveling to some other cities and it was amazing.

I haven't used lyft."
Louisville,"I have had a lot of good experiences with Lyft. 

I refuse to use Uber due to questionable business practices in their history.

Would avoid taxis unless you literally trip on an open one. If you try to call, they take forever to get to you"
Louisville,"Ridesharing services weren't available during my previous visits to Louisville. I've used various taxi services there without any negative comments. My drivers were safe, polite and knew the directions. 

Easily comparable to Chicago and St Louis cabbies, in a good way.

I've hailed from a smaller city and using taxis is a planned event. Most weekdays it's a 30 minute wait. Weekends you can count on a 45 minute to 2 hour wait, so it's best to get the driver's card and set planned pickup times and tip fat."
Louisville,"I drove for Lyft from April-July. I've had always positive experiences as the driver. I would judge how much talking the passengers would want, because each drive was different. I hope my passengers enjoyed their ride."
Louisville,"LYFT is the best by far because it's easy to use, especially if you've had a few too many. There's also plenty of drivers so you never have to wait long. Taxis are shady AF and Uber's app interface is weird. "
Louisville,"It’s totally pandemic-related. (I’ve asked drivers in Lou about it as well, and that’s what they’ve all said.) The only time I’ve ever had a long wait for either has been since that started. Since I came back to the US in Nov, big cities are the only place I haven’t had a shit wait."
Louisville,Pandemic related. I never had an issue with Uber or lyft from the airport before last year.
Louisville,"Throwing my vote in for pandemic related as well. While I've never specifically gotten one from the airport me and my friends would commonly be using uber/lyft with nary a problem and wait times usually around 5 minutes. We lived in the Clifton area at the time.

At one point I lived out past 265 and was still able to get an uber/lyft when I wanted one. Granted wait times were longer but I expected as much"
Louisville,"The plus side is, if you want to be an uber/lift driver once you move here, there are probably openings."
Louisville,I've noticed I can still get rides but the wait to get them is longer. I wasn't sure why but the pandemic makes sense.
Louisville,Pandemic related.  I travel fairly often and usually you get a pickup at the airport within 5 minutes even later in the evening.  Out in the metro area it can be a 10-15 minute wait.  I Needed a Lyft at the airport last week and it was a 25 minute wait.  I went with a Lyft lux instead and they were there within 5 minutes
Louisville,"Definitely pandemic. Uber/Lyft has been my go-to for soccer games and drinking events without fail, there's just not a lot of demand until things are more fully re-opened."
Louisville,"It’s common, unfortunately. I moved from the Colorado mountains so I was used to Denver or Salt Lake City Lyft where they pick you up in 10 minutes and you never have to wait for someone to accept your ride. I’ve had to wait so long here I end up cancelling and driving during peak times."
Louisville,"Yeah. Pre-covid - pre-B Taylor protests - uber/lyft was spot on. I’m sure now that things have calmed down, vaccinations and more stuff opening and getting back to normal - ride shares will follow. Don’t lose hope or patience."
Louisville,Many of us Uber drivers are waiting on our annual background checks to be completed. I have been down for 6 weeks. Others have been down longer.
Vanderbilt,"VSG has Lyft codes for rides to and from Nashville’s airport before and after the academic breaks. I’m not sure if it’s for every academic break or even if it’s still operational, but [here’s](https://www.instagram.com/p/CWJcxkGr8H_/?utm_medium=copy_link) an Instagram post about it. It also had codes for rides to and from destinations offering the COVID vaccine earlier in the pandemic ([Instagram post](https://www.instagram.com/p/CNnWRlLBDka/?utm_medium=copy_link)). I don’t think there’s a general Lyft discount fund, but interestingly, there [used to be](https://vanderbilthustler.com/15749/featured/vsg-announces-uber-campus-pass-opportunity/) Uber discounts [and](https://vanderbilthustler.com/17213/featured/uber-taken-off-commodore-card-and-replaced-with-lyft-credits/) Commodore Card credits for Lyft."
Vanderbilt,"The student government used to have a shuttle to the airport but it was so unreliable. I think they got rid of it a few years ago. You'll learn once you get here how useless the student government is. 

As far as getting to/from the airport just take an Uber. If you split it or take UberPOOL it should be less than $10. Plus you don't have to deal with the rude Nashville cab drivers who can't speak English and get lost on purpose."
Vanderbilt,"I think you'll be fine, and better off for it, as long as you know you'll be okay ocasionally sitting things out. The city bus is free with the student card, by the way, which is actually something I think most people don't know but that can be very useful when you want to get around and don't need/want to call a Lyft."
Vanderbilt,I have never had a problem with a scheduled ride. Had one on Thursday and the driver was at my place at 5:10 am.
Vanderbilt,You shouldn’t have a problem getting a ride. I’ve done it multiple times. A lot of drivers like the morning shifts driving to the airport
Vanderbilt,"Same here, I’ve scheduled Lyfts to BNA as early as 5:30am with no problem. That said, I’ve worried about it every time.

EDIT: typo"
Vanderbilt,Have had scheduled rides cancelled coming from Bellevue. No prior warning until pick up time. Multiple times.
Vanderbilt,"Worked for a client in New Mexico for nine months, traveling there Monday though Friday. Every Monday morning I had Uber or Lyft pick me up in B-wood at 4:00am, without failure."
Vanderbilt,"I took an uber from Mt. Juliet to BNA last month at 7 am with no problems. I overheard the driver on the phone say how she had a couple rides before mine, too"
Vanderbilt,"Vandy isn't going to hold you back in any way, but it isn't a feeder to type A companies (Berkeley is). Those companies usually want graduate students from top CS schools anyway, though, so if that's truly your dream it won't matter; you'll go on to grad school at a target. 

You can still network and try to break into a prop shop as an undergrad, but it's very difficult no matter what school you go to and you usually won't end up working as a quant. 

Contrary to popular belief prestige has the least importance for FAANG/Big N, which have enough money to send recruiters to a wide variety of schools. Prestige and location matter more for smaller companies.

It's really not necessary to take out loans for Princeton/Harvard/MIT when you have a full ride to Vandy and admissions to UCLA/UCB to choose from."
Vanderbilt,"Berkeley CS > UCLA > Vandy

But know this, at the end of the day, 90% of what you learn in classes is pretty much the same across most colleges (SJSU, berkeley, UIUC, etc) , because the core course content is usually the same. The biggest difference you'll actually see is a) the research and b) the recruitment. For both of these things berkeley is the best - proximity to the bay + long legacy of pioneering computing research is amazing - many of the internet's standards were invented at berkeley. Again, if all you care about is getting the actual job itself, it mostly doesn't matter, applications are online anyways. 

From what you've written in your post in terms of your goals, I would strongly recommend vandy if you have a full ride -- you'll save your parents a lot of money, will likely have smaller class sizes (less crowding than UC schools) and will still be able to get into FAANG/Quant trading. If you're interested in research, I would recommend Berkeley or UCLA.

One more thing: most employers dont care much where you went to school (or in some cases, if you even went to school), as long as its a semi decent accredited university. They care more about your actual CS skills."
Vanderbilt,"Vanderbilt is a great school and companies like Lyft and Two Sigma have been known to take people from there, so I doubt it would hold you back. In addition, Vanderbilt isn't as well known for CS in comparison to Berkeley, so you'd probably be able to stand out. However, if you are very confident in your skills in CS and Math, I would strongly recommend going to Berkeley. The competition will be more intense, but the Berkeley CS namebrand will help you in the long run when it comes to grad schools (and obviously going to berkeley itself for grad school). Best of luck!"
Vanderbilt,"Can't say for A (quant) but for big tech I don't think your school name is as important as other people make it out to be. I go to GT, (pretty solid CS school, have specific recruitment. Amazon likes to hire from us). GT definitely has useful resources for FAANG/big tech such as the career fair, but there are ways to get around this. Referrals imo are the most useful thing. Getting a referral to a big Tech basically gives you an interview, as long as your resume is decent (got an internship/good side project). If you have a referral to Amazon (for example) but go to a community college (no shame to community college goers, just using this as an example), the odds of you getting an interview with Amazon are probably higher than that of someone that goes to a target CS school (ivy-tier, berkeley, etc etc) but doesn't have a referral, given the exact same resume (same projects, internships).

&#x200B;

In this regard, go to the school that A. you want to go to B. can afford. The one thing I will say is that going to GT, I've realized I can get referrals from friends that interned at such big companies. This is the only advantage that a school like GT/Michigan/Berkeley can give you I think. Because there are so many CS majors at those schools (GT is like 20%), the odds of making a friend that interned/Full time at a big tech is super frickin high. (I honestly think it might be easier to get into FAANG from these schools rather than ivies, just because the tier of school is basically negligible since they are both solid, but the public schools are massive and you can network v well especially if you are social).

&#x200B;

Regardless, I think it comes down to building a network. Some schools may be easier to network into FAANG than others. However, if you want to go to a smaller school for other reasons (prestige, environment, pricing, whatever), you can still network in other ways. Just my 2 cents.

&#x200B;

Anyway I completely disregarded the quant firms because I have 0 experience in applying in those places so I dont think my info is accurate, but from what I hear Harvard (ivies in general) will prepare you better for those than big public schools. (I dont know many people from GT that work in fintech/quant, or people who are even interested in them tbh).

&#x200B;

Edit: Can't believe I forgot to say this but congrats full-ride to Vandy, that's awesome."
Vanderbilt,You can ride the city busses for free with your Vandy ID. That's a significant transportation perk.
Vanderbilt,A lot of people will suggest driving for lyft or uber. I understand that inviting strangers into your car (often drunk ones) can be a less than savory experience. That's why I drive for grubhub. No risk of unruly people getting in my vehicle just great smelling food.
Vanderbilt,"$1000 a month is really pushing it. I would echo what the earlier poster said, and look to sublet an apartment in Bellevue near Highway 70, because a bus line goes right through, and it's free for Vandy.  Living near the campus is all but impossible in today's market.  I would leave the car at home, since the mileage you put on it reduces value, have to pay for gas (as minimal as that is with a Prius) and then deal with traffic everyday near West End.  

From personal experience when I first moved there, Craigslist and LetGo (it's available now, wasn't back then) are good options for furnishing the apartment on the cheap.  A decent amount of apartments have gym facilities (limited as they may be, saves money).  

I'm not sure about Lyft or Uber because you have a busy schedule, so you can't really make much money unless you are available at peak times, or get lucky quite often.   I'm not sure what your abilities and availabilities are, so I can't really suggest jobs without it being total shots in the dark.  

Good luck."
Vanderbilt,Drive for lyft or uber if you have a car 
Vanderbilt,"Your income will not support your expenditures. You will be going into debt. You may wish to drive for uber or tutor or get a side job as you suggest, but I might just tell you that I would reckon that you'd walk away with debt. Depending on the degree, that could be good.

The richland park farmers market will take foodstamps, as will many vendors at the downtown farmers market. "
Vanderbilt,"People definitely survive on $12k/yr, but not easily. 

Consider thinking about ways to supplement your income: driving for lyft, tutoring students, even pick up an evening shift at a bar or restaurant. 

I don't know what kinds of hour requirements the assistantship has, but presumably it's 20 hrs per week, so you'll likely have enough free time to pick up a side hustle if you want. 

Nashville's housing market is pretty hairy especially near campus. Consider finding roommates who are also in grad school so you can split the cost of a parking pass, or take the bus. "
Vanderbilt,"start selling drugs,  uber or something. Goodluck with the $1000 a month thing"
Vanderbilt,"If I gave you 500 for a ride, can you get me a kickback for 250?"
Vanderbilt,"I work for Lyft and love Nashville, so just wanted to spread the love. The $500 expires in 2 weeks so the sooner you can start using it, the better. "
Vanderbilt,Facebook login is required.  I'll wait for Uber.  
Vanderbilt,"Used the app last night and this morning to go to work because I didn't feel like cleaning off my car. Both drivers arrived in 4 minutes and were extremely friendly. In the email receipt it shows your credit being applied. You can also see how much of your credit you've used in the ""Payment"" tab in the menu."
Vanderbilt,"tried to use this a few days ago but couldn't. when i tried to request a lyft all the app gives me is the message ""lyft is available in the greater nashville area"". after some searching on the web for the nashville coverage i figured out it was telling me that service wasn't available in my area. i only live 13 miles from the center of downtown. 

1) it's a pretty ambiguous error message.
2) their definition of ""the greater nashville area"" is way out of line with what anyone who is from here would think that means. 

was very annoyed i went through the act of putting in my credit card number and my facebook account only to find out no service at my house. "
Vanderbilt,I can't seem to get it to work. I want a ride. :(
Vanderbilt,"Had a good first experience with Lyft this morning.  My driver was super nice (even offered refreshments.) When I got the receipt, I saw that it used the credit (though it looked like it was going to charge to my card during the donation process.

Normally I'm a bit annoyed by facebook logins -- but in this case, I suspect it's being used as a measure to protect the driver (i.e., they know who you are if you turn out to be crazy.)"
Vanderbilt,"I lived car free for many years here and commuted year round. It’s entirely feasible to do as long as you’re willing to buy the correct gear for the rain and the lights for riding at night. The hardest part is if you’re trying to look presentable after riding in the summer but with the advent of ride shares and scooters this shouldn’t be an issue. 


Feel free to message if you have any questions. Good luck with your studies."
Vanderbilt,"If you want to do anything in Nashville outside of the Vandy area, you'll need a car. Unless you plan to Uber everywhere."
Vanderbilt,"I do exactly that - I live about a mile from VUMC and walk every day. I could bike, which cuts my commute down to about 10 min. That area is relatively flat, so biking is easy.

But that's just for my daily commute. This city isn't easy to navigate without a car, and I have a huge disdain for companies like Uber and Lyft, so I opted to keep my car. I really only drive it like once a week, but it would be difficult and expensive if I needed some other mode of transportation to bop around."
Vanderbilt,"I am a Vandy grad who loves the outdoors, also from the North. Few things based on your post and comments: 

1. There's apartments and rentals near the medical campus, so you can easily manage a sub-30 commute. However, if there will be times you need to arrive ASAP and not have a ~30 minute window, it may be exhausting unless you look at a few units that are immediately adjacent to campus. 

2. I get you're from Minnesota, but Nashville does indeed have a winter and the occasional sucky weather. Both snowfall and storms (including extreme thunderstorms) roll through, so consider that factor- though that can probably be nullified if you have the budget to uber, which is around 24/7 in Nashville. 

3. If you want to get out to hikes, you **will** need a car. 

4. Vandy has an outdoor club called WillSkills which grad students can participate in. Be sure to check it out if you have the time. There's also an excellent gym on campus.

5. Last I checked, there's no good grocery stores that are by the medical center or the super adjacent apartments. I have no knowledge of the bus routes. There is a Piggly Wiggly off West-End, but it's the opposite side of campus (near the stadiums)."
Vanderbilt,"Hey there - I've not had car for 7 years and bike everywhere. I live in east and work in midtown, it's entirely doable and city has gotten WAY more bike friendly over the years. If it rains take Lyft and the bus is a good option too if you're near a stop. Somebody else mentioned the humidity in the summer and that's totally true in regard to getting sweaty but sounds like that won't impact you in your workplace."
Vanderbilt,"It's doable. If you can swing slightly higher rent and/or a roommate, consider renting at the Grove. 30 minute walk or easy bike ride to vandy, $10 ride share or less if needed."
Vanderbilt,"I live right in that area and really only use my car to get groceries.  Everything else is definitely walkable/bikable. It's a less than 2 mile walk to get to downtown for major events and there are a ton of restaurants and bars around if you're into that kind of thing.

As others have mentioned, you can Uber/Lyft if needed and the groceries have great delivery service."
Vanderbilt,"I did 12yrs without a car. It was easy bike/bus/Lyft.

I’ve since moved 20 miles outside of town.

I really miss my bike."
Vanderbilt,You could use the Lyft rental program
Vanderbilt,"Not really, no. If you only go to work and never go anywhere else, you could do it, but you’ll be looking at other expenses (food/grocery deliveries/Uber) instead of the car expense. Nashville is also pretty dangerous for pedestrians and bikers, in general. The city bus system is not great, usable, but really not great. I would under no circumstances recommend Nashville without a car."
Vanderbilt,"NYC transplant. Still don’t have a car. My GF leases one and I’ll drive it on weekends, else I love Lyft."
Vanderbilt,"Believe specific to undergrade and specifically at one online college. 

On one end it seemed like a great deal but then on another side it seemed like it was just for English courses. 

I wonder if one person has ever got their Uber degree?"
Vanderbilt,"Yes, Undergrad.  You need 3000 rides and only need to maintain Gold status.  You can fall below acceptance/cancellation rate, you just need to get it back up again before the start of the next quarter.  Sign up and someone from ASU will call you within a week or two.  I'm two years into my Spanish degree. Great opportunity."
Vanderbilt,"Plus let's not forget the other  caveat, uber only pays after you exhaust all other financial aid."
Vanderbilt,"Knowing Uber, maybe community college. /s"
Duke,I’d say easiest to get a ride mid to early afternoon
Duke,"What I did was 

1. Wear a Duke shirt
2. Find another person in a Duke shirt (which will be very easy if you come around move-in)
3. Introduce yourself and split the Uber

Good luck!!"
Duke,Durham Cab Co is often cheaper than Uber.
Duke,Uber
Duke,Welcome to the triangle area! Only way you get around is via ubers unless you have a car
Duke,Uber or maybe RDU taxi service
Duke,https://meyourdu.com/ is a site that duke students use to split Ubers to and from RDU. If you have a lot of luggage make sure y’all request for an XL but otherwise this has been reliable.
Duke,"I just visited for ASW and while having a car would make it a lot easier, I think if you find an apartment near campus and a grocery store for essentials you should be okay. I took Uber’s around my entire weekend and most rides were less than $7 because things were close to campus. Also people were extremely kind so I’m sure you would not have a hard time finding rides if you are going to law school related things. Obviously I don’t live there so my experience is limited, but I would try connecting to other car less students to see how they would make it work! "
Duke,"Most current students at ASW said that while you can definitely live without one, having a car is a perk.

I'll be keeping my car if I end up at Duke, so y'all who need rides can definitely hit me up whenever."
Duke,"Currently attending Duke as an undergrad, and can confirm that you can 100% make it without a car. You can even make it without a bike, although a bike is a lovely option in Spring (they're available on campus spots to rent for short periods if you don't want to buy, but I don't really know the details). There are quite a few apartment complexes close enough that you can walk or rely on Duke's bus system, and there is a free program called Duke Vans that will take you home in the evening/night as long as you're within a certain radius of campus. Getting downtown to go out is possible by buses and even walking, but you'll probably want to Uber/Lyft - both of which are always available. Instacart in your groceries and make friends with people who do have cars for airport rides, etc. You can do it!"
Duke,"This question pops up a *lot* in the subreddit from prospective students and I have no clue who the fuck keeps telling people that Duke has a social hierarchy and is a social mess (probably people that look at random statistics instead of actually going to Duke lol). I'm kinda tired and have work I really need to be doing so I'm just gonna paste a response I gave a month ago to another prospective ED Asian. You'll get the added benefit that I also talk a lot about what living at Duke/in Durham is like.


(Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/duke/comments/9khxkp/prospective_student/)

--------------------------------------

So I'm an introverted Asian dude, not greek- or SLG-affiliated, that's spent more than two years here and I'm 90% sure that whoever you talked to was heavily involved in Greek life (not saying it's bad, but I don't think his/her opinions really match what Duke is) so here are my insights:

Greek life presence at Duke is - I'm not quite sure how to put it - overstated? There are plenty of people in Greek organizations and SLGs but if you're not in those, they kinda just...exist. Last time the topic of Greek life creating a social hierarchy came up on this subreddit, the most popular response was something along the lines of ""I don't notice it"". It's probably more of an issue if you were actually in a greek organization, but you don't seem like the kind of person who wants to rush so I'd say it's a nonfactor.

Parties: I'd say most people are down to chill or have a house party or something similar. The frat parties are just the most boisterous and noticeable parties. I'm a junior and have yet to go to anything of that sort that wasn't just a small house party.

Social scene is healthy outside of greek life. Whoever told you that people tend to lose their first semester friends is kind of correct, but imo it doesn't have much to do with rush. You just meet so many people in the first few weeks of school that it's inevitable that you don't stay friends with all of them; I'd say that it's very unlikely that you lose an actual friend to the rush process.

Unsafe my ass. Durham's safe as long as you aren't alone late at night or you don't venture into Southeast Durham (which is both relatively far from campus and devoid of anything appealing). I leave my door unlocked and have never felt unsafe leaving stuff (e.g. my laptop) in a common room while I go grab dinner or whatever (I've gotten into more trouble for like claiming the entire table with my stuff while being gone for hours)

There's a decent amount of stuff to do; not like city-level but it's not the middle of nowhere. Okay yeah Durham doesn't have a particularly great Asian food scene (disclaimer: originally from California so my standards are kinda high for this) but it's not like barren in terms of Asian food. The food scene in general though is great.

Note that if you or someone you know has a car (or if you're down to Uber/Lyft), you'd be able to go to things in Cary or Chapel Hill or Raleigh which vastly increases the amount of things you can do/eat."
Duke,4am-9am is a good time to get easy no nonsense rides. The vast majority of those pax are going to work or to the airport
Duke,"probably if you work at 9. 5pm+ can work but tends to be less per hr. in my area. The benefit though is you have flexibility about when and where you finish. This can make your driving much more effecient

Possibly drive with destination set towards your work in the moring for 1 or 2 rides. And then for a couple hrs after work. That's what I think works best for 9-5 schedule..... OR, if you need serious cash, start like 4am and you can get plenty of good paying rides before work."
OSU,">pay for our safety

Dont let anyone tell you these drivers are nearly as well vetted. Safe ride drivers were OSU students who had to pass a FULL background check and maintain training as members of the Department of Public Safety."
OSU,"Nothing stops Lyft from just raising the rates in OSU service area. Safety ride features was never for convenience but for safety. It worked adequately in providing safety. The tapride app needed some work, but that doesn't mean that USG should be just allowed to kill it."
OSU,"I personally think this is a good idea, though I might not be in the majority. The sheer volume of Lyft drivers in the area will more than make this worth it, though idk how effective the Safe Ride was before as I never used it. Many of my friends would use Uber/Lyft anyways last year, and this service being offered for ~$2 per ride (less than a full cycle of laundry) makes me think it'll be very useful and very effective."
OSU,free ride to get dominos at latenight:-)
OSU,"the Lyft pass shouldn't be dependent on tips, I never had it deactivate due to that. if you went to the Kroger in clintonville then that is outside of the service area which would cause the Lyft pass to not work. if you went to the one near short north then that's odd and should've worked. also keep in mind you have to do a standard ride and the ""Wait and Save"" option in order to get the discount. Here's a link to the documentation with the service area and guidelines: [Lyft Ride Smart ](https://ttm.osu.edu/ride-smart)"
OSU,"The way the pass works, is OSU basically gives Lyft a set amount of money, almost like a giant gift card every month for all students. Then as the month goes by the money slowly runs down and sometimes out. Considering it’s the end of the month, that’s likely what happened"
OSU,"Nah you gotta show us the name of the driver, so we can all give the driver 1 star if we ever get the same driver"
OSU,This is why I hated that OSU got rid of their own late night driver system and opted for Lyft where it’s random ass people picking up college kids. I know we all use Uber and Lyft to go to bars and all that but just seemed wrong to change the system from actual OSU employees. Actually USG is the one that opted for the change so they can screw off (as always). Sorry op that this happened to you :/
OSU,"they should have safe ride *and* the Lyft program. I use(d) them for different things.. safe ride to get home from campus at night, and the Lyft program to get cheap rides to and from bars/friends at night. Having both would've helped solve the long wait times of the safe ride system"
OSU,This is why they should have never gotten rid of safe ride. Some people will never ever get into a car of a complete stranger alone and so the program is inequitable.
OSU,"always use it around campus, I’ve gotten tons of ride for under a dollar. never a problem"
OSU,"Lyft is comparable to Uber. Basically the same service and many drivers drive for both apps. 

Just keep in mind the campus area discount only works from 9p-3a (or something like that)."
OSU,"Hope the tour guides weren't hyping up our ""free safety ride program"" all summer."
OSU,I can't wait to use this as it was not intended for $2 rides to short north bars
OSU,Safe Ride worked fine for me. It's infuriating that we have to pay now.
OSU,"cool stuff THE Ohio State University has done!

- outsourced energy (for the next 50 years)

- outsourced parking (for the next 50 years)

- outsourced safe rides

- signed an exclusive beverage deal (for 10 years, three decades in a row)

- created classes that require a specific 300 dollar product for every student"
OSU,"It looks like this area doesn't cover University Village at all, which with the old Safe Ride, had limited service to after 12:30 am (like, okay I kinda get that). UV buses only run until 10pm, so a resident's only option is to either use COTA and walk from Ackerman or Riverside, or just get a regular Uber/Lyft. I think this program concept overall is great, but I wish the current ride share had just been modified to fit students' needs better. That money could've easily gone towards getting another vehicle or two."
OSU,Am I the only one who was actually really excited to see this? Safe ride always had absurdly long wait times which is why I never used it. Usually a Lyft shows up about 5 minutes after I call it. Maybe I've just gotten unlucky with safe ride but to me this seems like a great move by OSU.
OSU,"Ohio State sure does care about our safety. This isn't a move made based on money at all. No way. 

I'll wait for someone to be attacked, assaulted, or raped by their driver and then let the legal games begin. 

They may be cutting down on wait times, but there were many ways to fix the student safety program that would've helped while maintaining a free, and actually safe program. Not replacing it for the rich students who can afford a $2 ride every night, and also with drivers who aren't vetted at all. Oh well, Ohio State will learn there lesson after we have something terrible happen because they wanted to save a few dollars"
OSU,"Dont forget this was supported by administration AND USG! The Safe Ride program also gave double or triple that amount of rides in a year previously.

And dont let OSU tell you they dont put a price on safety!"
OSU,"The safe ride program was great in theory, but it in actuality it was slow, and long waits, and not the easiest to use. If the 10,000 rides are a reasonable number, then this makes a lot of sense"
OSU,"Safety is our missing name. Cause when you are trying to get home and its late, lyft is the safest option. SMH"
OSU,What stops Lyft from just raising the rates for OSU service area by USD 4?
OSU,"There are only 10,000 discounted rides a month. Resets on Monday."
University of Minnesota,"I have, might be a bit pricier but usually there's drivers in the cities all night."
University of Minnesota,Ive taken Ubers at all hours and never had an issue
University of Minnesota,Book an uber ride. Is advance booking something you've never tried before?
University of Minnesota,You can request an driver on the spot or set up a pick up time in the scheduler .
University of Minnesota,I actually got a ride to the airport around 4 am couple of months ago and i found lyft is the cheapest and they have a lot more drivers around that time than you think
University of Minnesota,I flew about 3-4 times for a 6am flight from MSP airport in the past year. I had no issue finding an Uber at around 3:00-3:30am near where I live. I did not schedule a ride in advance because they cost like 54$ the last time I checked.
University of Minnesota,"Maybe try asking in the IEEE and ACM Discords. For some reason a lot of engineering firms and software firms are in Plymouth.

To be honest though, you might need to get a car though. That was the reason I had to get my driver's license."
University of Minnesota,"here's a fun fact: when Austin, TX passed a similar ordinance Uber & Lyft did make good on their threats and pulled out of the city, but pretty much as soon as they did a new company called Ride Austin started up that offered the same level of service (just on a very local level) that paid people adequately AND got them around for similar prices. The only reason Ride Austin doesn't exist anymore is because Uber & Lyft came back and a global pandemic broadly tanked needs for rideshares for a year."
University of Minnesota,Yup. Uber ran the same ad on KFAN this morning. They're pumping a lot of money into the campaign meant to keep them from having to pump money into their drivers bank accounts
University of Minnesota,"Lyft and Uber didn't pull out of Seattle, NYC or other cities that have passed a livable wage for drivers.

Don't give in to threats. That's how we ended up building the Vikings a new stadium."
University of Minnesota,I heard an Uber commercial on the radio today calling for us to contact the city to ensure they stay. lol whatever it takes to keep them from paying a fair share
University of Minnesota,"I think the issues with it last time were:

1) the price increases would be material. Just looked on Lyft. Target field to MSP would be ~$27 before tip. With this legislation, the driver would be paid ~$26 for the trip ($1.40 * 13 miles + $0.51 * 15 min) before tip. Lyft/Uber & taxi companies are going to take their margin resulting in higher prices.

2) this only applies to ride share drivers & not other gig drivers (instacart, etc.)

3) drivers wanted employment protection to the point where only a conviction would result in Lyft/Uber being able to deactivate the driver immediately.

4) ride share drivers would be treated different than taxi drivers."
University of Minnesota,"As a part time Uber driver since 2015, the knucklehead drivers behind this can go shove it.


 It's a job you literally don't have to apply for and I average over 30 dollars an hour when I drive, that is, anywhere from 4-10 on the weekdays and 12-10 on the weekends if I do choose to drive.  


Anyone who isn't making shockingly good money for a near zero skill job is doing something horribly wrong. 


Now I'm not saying we line Lyft and Ubers pockets because fuck them too, but a minimum wage guarantee for drivers is asshattery to the highest degree.  


I drive for additional spending money AND the fantastic conversations and connections I can make with people. I can confidently say I'm far more worldly for driving nearly 10 years with how many people I've interacted with. Instead of sitting in a nice little cocoon of safety I'm out meeting people from all parts of the cities and the globe"
University of Minnesota,"Speaking as someone who doesn't have a car, this is the best option. Public transportation in this city is good to the point where Uber and Lyft really aren't my go to options. These Multi billion dollar companies are just throwing a hissy fit cus they can't exploit their workers anymore."
University of Minnesota,"I love how gig workers want the freedom of being a contractor and the protection of being a standard employee. You can have one, or the other. You can't have both. No ones forcing you to work for lyft. If you want a minimum wage, Walmart is hiring."
University of Minnesota,"Does anyone know if there is actual data available on this?  The articles seem to only mention anecdotal reports from drivers and Lyft and Uber are saying fares will double.   There truth is probably somewhere in the middle but really difficult to determine.

Obviously Uber and Lyft used cheap rates to undercut taxis, but at the same time it never seemed like it was meant to be someone’s full time job."
University of Minnesota,Let them leave. Fuck em. Another rideshare company will come in. 
University of Minnesota,"Lyft has pretty much given up on this market anyway. Their prices are not competitive and even if you do a request a ride, the chances of a driver accepting it are slim. "
University of Minnesota,"So if this passes, that means I don’t have to tip? Because this driver is earning a living wage and therefore I don’t need to subsidize their pay?"
University of Minnesota,"Implementing minimum wage laws on rideshare hasnt caused Lyft or Uber to leave a municipality yet. See: Seattle, NYC"
University of Minnesota,"""Rideshare companies will stop operating which will make rideshares twice as expensive. "" 
I'm not sure they understand what they're writing."
University of Minnesota,"Fwiw this is just they’re playbook, and ultimately an empty threat to get you to vote and advocate for their profit interests and not that of their drivers. I moved here from San Francisco in January and they were sending these emails to SF and Bay Area rideshare users with almost the exact same wording when we were considering similar measures there a couple years ago. 

Ultimately the measure passed by a wide margin against the rideshare companies and their predatory practices and they did nothing except raise their prices a bit, like maybe 5%-10%. Their threats of pulling out of the market were empty and that this would kill their industry was all just a bluff. The price increase though could also be interpreted as unrelated to the measure and as more a result of inflation than anything for that time."
University of Minnesota,"I got one from Uber too.

Is anyone especially concerned about making it harder for Uber/Lyft to remove drivers after a safety incident? I'm sure there are people who make false reports, but as a woman, I'm way more concerned about my driver having harassed/assaulted a rider, and then still being allowed to drive me the next day."
University of Minnesota,"It would be collectively awful if we lost rideshare apps. But I understand the wage arguments. 

Lyft and Uber made a bad decision banking on automated driving far too soon. 

But I also remember the days of having to negotiate $60 cash fares with cabs just to get somewhere close. It was not a fun time."
University of Minnesota,"So how would this actually work in practice - I get a ride pick up in Saint Paul and want to go to US Bank Stadium. Would the driver drop me off on the border? Drop me off at US Bank and then have to drive outside of Minneapolis proper to get another pick up? 

Seems totally infeasible and an empty threat even from a logistics perspective"
University of Minnesota,"I rely on Uber/Lyft 4x a week to get home since Metro Transit decided to cancel my early morning route.  I see profiles that show drivers have been doing it for several years in many cases, why are they still driving if they're not making decent money?"
University of Minnesota,If your business would fall apart by paying workers a living wage maybe it isn't a sustainable one and you shouldn't be paying your CEO up to [$980 million](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-lyft-ceos-unusual-pay-structure-is-a-sign-of-the-times-bbc2bbd4) in stock
University of Minnesota,"The rideshare companies have done this everywhere with any regulations and haven't stopped operating anywhere. 

Certainly, go [read the rules yourselves](https://lims.minneapolismn.gov/Download/FileV2/32072/Transportation-Ride-Share-Worker-Protection-Ordinance.pdf) and ask your councilmember to represent your ideals. 

Lyft or any rideshare company urging a no vote is an automatic yes vote from me."
University of Minnesota,"Passing the buck down to the consumer will happen. What everyone should realize is that without cheap labor or money companies like Uber/Lyft wouldn't exist. 

It's why Lyft isn't profitable and Uber only just barely became profitable for the first time in its entire history."
University of Minnesota,I think Minneapolis should take this time to put money back into local rideshare. Incentivizing cab companies to make their own apps and or making their own. I was on a lyft the other day (missed my bus) and it was apart of a Minneapolis Transit effort.
University of Minnesota,Translation: “If you force us to start paying drivers a livable wage then we’ll have to stop tricking drivers into thinking they can earn a livable wage.”
University of Minnesota,"""Everybody let us do what we want and nobody gets hurt!"" Fuck off, Lyft."
University of Minnesota,"This is what happens when we start relying on transportation as a private service as opposed to a public service. If Lyft/uber/whoever cannot be profitable while also paying their employees (they'd say contractors) acceptable wages, then maybe they just shouldn't exist."
University of Minnesota,"I was looking for more information online after I got this email myself and I learned that Walz actually vetoed a ridershare wage increase bill at the state level in May, and (supposedly) created a committee tasked with researching rideshare issues to ""shape policy for next year's legislative session.""

https://sahanjournal.com/business-work/a-proposed-ordinance-to-increase-wages-for-uber-and-lyft-drivers-in-minneapolis-has-both-rideshare-apps-threatening-to-leave/

Sounds like the city council didn't want to wait. Frey is still undecided on the issue, according to that article.

I don't have much sympathy for the rideshare providers. Just because they refuse to treat their drivers like employees doesn't mean those workers should be exempt from minimum wage requirements."
University of Minnesota,The last time Uber and Lyft hid behind disabled people in Dakota County. I wonder what the excuse will be this time.
University of Minnesota,"I only use rideshare when I go out to concerts or the airport. If rates have to go up slightly to cover fair wages, then so be it. That said, there should be some transparency involved in this process and overseen by the state of Minnesota so that companies don’t flat out gouge customers under the guise of “uNfAiR rEgUlaTioNs”"
University of Minnesota,Lyft is usually twice as expensive as Uber right now anyway... They have bigger issues than this they need to resolve first just to keep their current market.
University of Minnesota,"Saying this as a non-driver who relies heavily on Lyft here: Lyft can eat it. I got this same type of email when they were pushing Prop 22 in San Francisco and I’m still furious that that passed. They weren’t ever going to leave San Francisco, much less CA as a whole (which they were literally threatening—like, come on), and they quite likely won’t leave here either. If they do, there will be other options."
University of Minnesota,"good, fuck lyft and uber those vultures  
  
tip your drivers"
University of Minnesota,"""Dear Lyft

I am a cabbie. I hope you leave"""
University of Minnesota,"""They'd earn less due to fewer ride requests"" 

As opposed to dog shit rides worth 4$? Lol?"
University of Minnesota,"What a bunch of bullshit bullying tactics…

There is NO fucking way Uber or Lyft are going to take their services out of the 16th largest metro in the fucking country.

Boo-fucking-hoo! Pay your fucking drivers!"
University of Minnesota,Uber sent me the same email word-for-word
University of Minnesota,"We only have 4.67 billion dollars!!! You’ll have to pay the drivers more because we just couldn’t possibly pay our drivers a livable wage, we’re too poor!!!"
University of Minnesota,The pay isn’t the biggest problem. They can’t deactivate drivers who pose safety issues without five days written notice. Think about how dumb that is.
University of Minnesota,"Fuck em. There are smaller, some co-op based rideshare companies here who would greatly benefit from the duopoly collapsing under its own greed."
University of Minnesota,Oh I'm sure these companies making drivers operate at a net loss or best case less than minimum wage really care about the drivers 🙄
University of Minnesota,"So will they stop operating or double their prices? Do they just expect us to also believe that higher wages is both unsafe and costly? Costly I understand for riders Why is it unsafe for anyone?

Edit: I see the bit about allowing drivers to continue, but I have no idea what Lyft does now other than using its ratings to prioritize. Not sure that is a real safety check"
University of Minnesota,Call their bluff. If paying their drivers minimum wage is too burdensome so be it.
University of Minnesota,"Fuck lyft

dumbass corporation bitching about having to follow some rules. I wish they would GTFO out of my city, but my dumbass city council have no principles or spine to do anything."
University of Minnesota,"Lyft is starting to sound like Purdue Pharma.

#Greed"
University of Minnesota,"Things at risk in Minneapolis:

1. Lyft
2. Personal Protection
3. your safety
4. parental rights
5. Tax dollars
6. cash apps
7. sobriety
8. Healthcare
9. Liberty 
10. Freedom to be Christian 
11. Education free from indoctrination 
12. Sky High Rent
13. Sky high Tuition 
14. Most importantly your vote from being overwhelmed by illegals w MN ID's"
University of Minnesota,"Hmm...this makes me feel like their local lobbying might not be as effective. There is no justifiable reason why the company can't keep operating affordably even if they have to pay their drivers more. On a side note, I read somewhere today that despite inflation and a decline in profits, Medtronic's CEO pay ratio to their median worker **increased** from 215:1 to 230:1.

Feel free to raise your prices or do whatever you want Lyft, but understand that a possible consequence is that the market won't react favorably. What you won't do is feign concern about the well-being of the drivers and costs to the customers when we know that all you care about is your profit. 

I'll be telling the City Council to vote ""Yes"". My deepest sympathy to your shareholders and investors."
University of Minnesota,"While typically I would agree market openings lead way to better competitors, we’ve already seen the alternatives so far from traditional taxi companies. Apps like iHail, zTrip, and Ridesure are out there and they all suck across the board from inconsistent payments, bad updating of location, and terrible interfaces.

Given the cost of becoming a licensed ride share company in the city (btw none of those apps are) it’s a huge uphill battle for new entrants."
University of Minnesota,"Politely, you really have no idea what you are talking about. From both a basic economics standpoint and the basics of running a business basically everything you wrote is nonsense.

Any new entity that tried to replace Uber/Lyft in just the metro would likely need to make significantly more operating profit just to be able to cover their fixed costs and stay in business. And they would have a much smaller customer base to do it with. And to be clear, we're not talking about the whole Twin Cities, it's just Minneapolis and St. Paul, so you're really looking at a market of less than a million.

And that doesn't even begin to account for the fact that Uber/Lyft were able to build their infrastructure over a decade during a much lower interest rate environment and operated at significant losses for years. Apparently this new company just needs to be willing to make less money than companies than have famously lost billions of dollars before they even became profitable? 

And creating the app would probably be one of the easier parts of getting the business of the ground. Both dealing with the legal aspects and successfully recruiting a reliable driver base are going to be a much harder part of getting this sort of business started.  

And an extra $1 a ride would almost certainly not come close to meeting minimum salary demands of riders, let alone all the other costs associated."
University of Minnesota,"A fellow in Seattle just has a static website and gets calls. RidesbyDan or something. He advertised on Craigslist. 
The article I read says he is happier and makes more now."
University of Minnesota,"No one:

Op: just create a new ride hailing service without economies of scale"
University of Minnesota,"I can't tell if this is a horrible sarcastic post or an OP seriously out of touch with reality, but I know this is truly a case of ""if this was so damn simple it'd been done""

> The second, is to be willing to make less money than Lyft and Uber do per ride. Making the app is the hard part, but after that it's just maintenance. Keep it running well and you have a turnkey operation on your hands. You do not need to make that much money per ride to be successful, you just need to make some money. Even if it's only a dollar a ride, there is around 4 million people in the Twin Cities. That dollar would add up very quickly.

https://www.reuters.com/technology/uber-posts-first-small-adjusted-profit-ridership-rises-delivery-gets-more-2021-11-04/

Please feel free to read. Look at when that article was made. Look at how much they lost. Think about how long you've known of the term ""Uber"", and how only two years ago did they finally make money. 

For this to have stemmed with looking out for driver's pay and ending with ""oh, don't worry about yourself making money"" is comical"
University of Minnesota,"In addition to all of the other reasons this will be terrible, I use Uber and Lyft all of the time to avoid a DUI, as well as avoid mistakenly killing someone.  If you go to a bar and have 2-3 drinks you are over the limit, and driving home can put you in jail, cost you your job, cost $10,000, etc.  This will also cause deaths due to people still wanting to go out, only having to drive themselves."
University of Minnesota,"Other competition already exists, and its terrible.  Uber and Lyft came in because cabs were overpriced, and inconvenient.  

Do I agree that Uber and Lyft drivers should make more?  Absolutely.  But, the only way they can make more is if Uber and Lyft CHARGE more.  Uber and Lyft are already basically the perfect example of capitalism, since the rides are priced based on the supply of drivers to the supply of riders.  Should that change?  Having never driven for Uber or Lyft I really am unqualified to say one way or the other.  But if it does, you'll pay that cost, Uber and Lyft certainly won't eat it."
University of Minnesota,"Ride-sharing is unfortunately not a profitable venture… Uber’s whole plan was the corner the market so that when they had a fleet of self-driving cars, they could finally start cashing in without having to pay drivers. 

What we need is better public transportation that’s already paid for by our tax dollars so that we don’t have to spend $30 every time we want to go anywhere"
University of Minnesota,"This is funny because the process for building a competitor business that you just described was the process Uber and Lyft used...so you're just saying ""hey, somebody DIY recreate an enormous company real quick, what's the big deal?"" 

I don't support Uber or Lyft but this argument as you've voiced it is silly level of naive"
University of Minnesota,"I'm hoping those drivers go to work for Metro Transit instead.  Their biggest problem is finding staff, and a fully staffed agency would make rideshares mostly unnecessary.

For extenuating circumstances, there are still traditional taxi services that maintain their own vehicles and pay drivers as employees, the way Uber and Lyft should be doing anyway."
University of Minnesota,"I can’t wait to download a new rando, glitchy app to get from point a to b.

I’m not worried about it, I don’t think Uber or Lyft is going anywhere, it’s too valuable and will fuck up too much stuff if it goes away."
University of Minnesota,This is a bluff.  They’ll simply introduce price floors and rides will cost more to consumers.
University of Minnesota,I was talking with one of my Lyft drivers and was relatively new to the country. He was renting a car from Lyft for $250 a week and didn’t realize he was going to be taxed out the ass on the money earned.
University of Minnesota,"You're just optimistic, lol. Do it yourself OP

>The second, is to be willing to make less money than Lyft and Uber do per ride.

...they aren't making money. This entire post is so dumb"
University of Minnesota,"Not sure I agree with everything in OP's post, but it's true that a substantial reason for Uber/Lyft's success is that they 1) haven't ever had to make a profit, and 2) don't pay their workers fairly.

Uber and Lyft are a net detriment to the Twin Cities because they aren't regulated and they pull people off public transit. 

We should invest in more frequent, cleaner, better-staffed public transit and let taxi companies fill whatever demand exists for Uber and lyft."
University of Minnesota,Wait my next door neighbors are immigrants and the husband is an Uber/lyft driver and he has a new baby. I’d hate for him to be suddenly out of work 😭😭 so many immigrants do ridesharing
University of Minnesota,Uber and Lyft would pull out because MN recognizing their workers as employees and not contractors would open up the flood gate of legal liability in other states (as MN would be a direct point of comparison). Their long-term wellbeing would depend on them pulling out. The company has been systemically losing cases for years now and is delaying the inevitable. Fuck Uber and Lyft and their soulless business practices. I hope MN calls their bluff and makes them pull
University of Minnesota,"Generally speaking, when a service disappears its usually gone for good. Uber and Lyft were only ever affordable at the beginning because they were being pumped with venture capital at ludicrously low interest rates. But once investors started demanding a return on their investment and interest rates went up these ride share companies needed to start making a profit. There are two major ways to make a profit (in the eyes of the capitalist); cut costs and increase prices. The fact that Uber/Lyft are pulling out of the market because ***minimum wage*** makes their business model unprofitable means their business model doesn't work, at least without operating at a loss. 

So if the business model failed, no one will come in to replace them because no one can make a profit off of the business model. If they did we would still have street car companies and milk men. Now there is a way for services to be preserved, and that is if we replace the investor with the tax payer. We *could* spin an uber/lyft style company off as an agency and use our collective pooled money to fund it. but we already have something like that, and the agency is called Metrotransit. 

I agree with you that the exit of Uber/Lyft could be a net positive, but not because better version of the ride share model will appear. But because some of the supply and demand will move to public transit options."
University of Minnesota,Ride share apps exploit workers. Trains and busses are the way.
University of Minnesota,"And bus/light rail were like “Hi? We have been always here for you…?”   

All of this Uber/Lyft problem won’t be severe if urban planning priorities the city zoning around the bus and light rail routes… It is a time-tested and proven system since before Ancient Roman time. Single family housing zoning is a huge problem."
University of Minnesota,"This seems like a spot for a business like Empower to come in and thrive. I’m not totally advocating for it, and it has its issues, but it is cheaper, and riders typically make more as well."
University of Minnesota,"Imagine if we had a company that actually had to EMPLOY rideshare drivers…. Maybe they would even be required to provide vehicles and check on licensure…. Oh, like ducking taxis used to do?!?! Yes, pass this shit! Uber and lift are criminal exploitation. Often of immigrants"
University of Minnesota,"Uber and Lyft leaving Minneapolis would cost me personally negatively affect me because that’s what I exclusively use for transportation. I will use any alternative that takes their place. 

I’m not talking Metro Transit, ever. And as a poor person receiving DAC, it would save lots of money, but I refuse to take it out of principle. So the car abolitionists that are advocating for this can kiss my ass."
University of Minnesota,"There will be a small interruption, then someone else will step in that will follow the rules.

Lyft and Uber have no ""special sauce"" anymore. When they left Austin years ago, well-running alternatives popped up within months.

Anyway, I find it hilarious how people turn into captain capitalist when it comes to defending uber and lyft in these threads."
University of Minnesota,"Who is forcing the drivers to work for Uber or lyft? Are they not aware of the pay before the start driving? I haven't taken many rides with these companies, but when I have,it seemed like it was more of a second job. Or even a hobby for some of the drivers."
University of Minnesota,"I take Uber often. I love talking to drivers. So many incredible stories & journeys.
I always tip 50%. 
It is an unsustainable model….though when it’s needed it is very needed."
University of Minnesota,"If the Uber and Lyft drivers are not making enough they should quit... That's the true market, if it's not paying enough stop doing it. Lyft and Uber would be required to pay more. That's how it's supposed to work."
University of Minnesota,The app could easily be run by AI and the drivers should get the majority of the money.
University of Minnesota,"Exactly, something else will fill that void. I use a semi-local service for grocery delivery called Buncha (they’re also in Denver) and it’s almost the same as Instacart but set delivery days so much cheaper. 

I also have been using another local company—  Evie Car share /Hourcar instead of Uber/lyft for a while now, because it ends up being much cheaper. (I just pay for the $7 monthly membership which is actually drive credits and then cancel immediately after since I tend to not use it every month.) Obviously this doesn’t help people who don’t / can’t drive, but it’s just to say, Uber and Lyft aren’t that special. Sure it was special back when they created it but it’s not impossible to replicate."
University of Minnesota,"Pre-COVID, I thought that having ""slug lanes"" would have been beneficial to cut down traffic on 35W and 394. They're basically organized group hitchhiking common in the Northern Virginia suburbs of DC. [http://www.slug-lines.com/](http://www.slug-lines.com/)  Drivers pick up passengers at designated origin points in the suburbs, use the HOV lanes, then drop off at center points downtown. Do the reverse in the evening. No coordination required."
University of Minnesota,"I try to use Lyft but Uber connects me with a driver much faster. Recently I’ve stopped trying Lyft because it won’t connect to a driver, especially from the airport."
University of Minnesota,"Lyft links to my Delta account as well as earning me more points through my credit card, but I still check both. If it’s within a couple bucks I’ll go Lyft."
University of Minnesota,"In my experience over the last year, they've gotten very close to each other. On average, Lyft is a little less expensive, and Uber slightly more reliable in terms of timing and finding drivers. I did have a very strange experience with Uber this summer where the driver somehow kept the ride going after dropping me off, resulting in a $200 ride for what was supposed to be $30, but Uber customer service fixed it right away."
University of Minnesota,"It depends on the situation for me. There are situations where I can save some money and wait a little longer, and that is usually with Lyft about 90% of the time. Lyft drivers give me better ratings to compared to Uber drivers. However, I can usually get a ride pretty quick with Uber."
University of Minnesota,"I mainly use Lyft because someone stole my debit card info, used Uber, I then reported it, and they locked and banned my account

If that's any indication....I never had a bad experience until that shitshow of a response."
University of Minnesota,"I've had better luck with Lyft, specifically when I try to schedule rides ahead of time. Sometimes I want to schedule a ride ahead of time when I need a morning ride, and Uber's app constantly glitches out and says I'm unable to, despite it supposedly being a function available on the app. I never have had that problem with Lyft, so I use Lyft. I like the peace of mind knowing I won't forget. Never had any problem finding a driver either."
University of Minnesota,"I use whichever one is cheaper, though I will prefer Uber if I need to get moving quickly. Lyft tends to bounce me around from one driver to another (and not because they're canceling!) which is very, very annoying."
University of Minnesota,Whichever one's cheaper in that exact moment you need a ride
University of Minnesota,Uber
University of Minnesota,"I only use Uber, but I tend to need very late night rides and Uber seems to have more drivers at that time. The airport is really the only time I may check out both platforms since it’s a long ride for me.

I have been to cities where Lyft is significantly cheaper, probably taking more losses to gain market share. I’ve been in NYC before where Lyft was much cheaper on all rides, so I used it for the duration of my trip."
University of Minnesota,"They’re both exactly the same and made up of the same exact drivers, most of whom use both apps. 

Just check the price on both apps and order whichever one is cheaper at that moment for that trip."
University of Minnesota,"Used to be Lyft, but now Uber seems to be about 25% cheaper"
University of Minnesota,"Uber by a mile, really consistent for me. Lyft might be getting better now, but for a couple of years I almost never had a Lyft ride not cancel/show up less than 10 minutes late."
University of Minnesota,As a new Lyft driver. . . Lyft
University of Minnesota,"Unfortunately, usually Uber. I've been screwed by Uber a few times and try not to use them, but they're almost always available (there have been times where I haven't even been able to get a Lyft, and not even weird times/locations, I'm talking 10pm on a Thursday in North Loop), and I've never had a particularly bad/sketchy Uber (had some really bad Lyft rides, and about ¼ of the time, the car feels unclean and/or beat up)."
University of Minnesota,I can't answer this but would like to know the same info for The Andover/Coon Rapids/Anoka area.  Have never used ride share.  Thanks
University of Minnesota,Ubers usually cheaper for me here but there less drivers generally
University of Minnesota,I’d say both are very close. In a smallish sample size though I’ve had more consistent luck with faster pickup with Uber from MSP
University of Minnesota,Maybe try an upgraded option with Uber or Lyft? Isn't there usually an option for a professionally licensed limo driver that drive big SUVs?
University of Minnesota,I go with whoever is cheaper so I can tip the driver heavier.
University of Minnesota,"Lyft's business model is to copy everything Uber does, and they often share drivers, so they're really the same thing."

University of Minnesota,"If Uber and Lyft's business models cannot support a living wage for drivers, why should they exist?"
University of Minnesota,"What I actually want put into law hasn't been proposed, which is actual visibility. Uber et all have a lot of talking points about what revenue share the drivers get, which completely doesn't seem to line up with what the uber drivers are saying. I should be able to see the dollar amount that goes to the driver in real time when I pay and they should be audited with hell to pay if what they tell the consumer doesn't line up with reality. Would even be nice to have it mandated by law to put next to that the averaged expenses and taxes the driver pays for that revenue, and their estimated actual profit.

A lot of what I actually see proposed seems heavy-handed and misguided and so far I've been relieved by the vetoes."
University of Minnesota,"Uber and Lyft: If you can't provide a living wage, not only should you leave Minneapolis, but you should be shut down.  You don't have a viable business model."
University of Minnesota,"This wouldn't be a problem if Walz didn't veto a bipartisan bill that had support of every DFL member in the House and Senate.

Uber threatened to leave Oregon, Texas and other states where they've set increased rates and not once have they followed through.

Folks in this sub and /r/Minnesota were all about raising their wages when the bill passed and argued that paying these drivers a livable wage was more important than the cost to those who use the service. As soon as Walz vetoed it then they flipped and go on about how disabled and low income need the service. 

First, both services still gives low income substantially discounted rides if driver pay goes up. They wouldn't pay more, just everyday users.

Secondly, disabled folks get their rides covered by the state. If the price of Uber goes up because we pay drivers a livable wage, it just means they charge the state more. Walz could easily put more into the budget for such. They also have access to services like Metro Transit and Metro Mobility, along with taxi vouchers. And if you're going to argue ""What about those outside the metro?"", recognize that most rural communities don't have Uber and Lyft.

Walz needs to stop surrendering to big money. Giving in to Uber and Lyft at the expense of the drivers and giving in to Mayo at the expense of the nurses."
University of Minnesota,Every time I ride an Uber/Lyft the driver tells me how they’re getting paid less and less
University of Minnesota,"Just an FYI, Minneapolis taxi drivers have their rates set by the city, and they currently are $2.50 per mile/42 cents a minute.

In contrast, our esteemed Mayor Frey feels that $1.41 per mile/50 cents a minute is WAY too much. Even at those rates, rideshare drivers will be FAR below the poverty level."
University of Minnesota,Who the heck can afford an Uber or lyft anyway these days?
University of Minnesota,"The Minneapolis City Council has resurrected plans to raise wages and expand the rights of Uber and Lyft drivers — and the companies have resurrected their threats to leave town if those plans move forward.

The battle, strikingly similar to one that played out last year, sprang anew before a Minneapolis City Council committee Tuesday. The subject of a public hearing was a proposed ordinance that would pay drivers a minimum of $1.40 per mile and 51 cents per minute while transporting riders on any trip within the city limits, among other guarantees.

Mayor Jacob Frey vetoed a similar plan last year. The primary difference this year could be political math: Following last year's election, the council has shifted slightly left, and it's possible the current council could override his veto where the last council didn't — if things head that way.

Tuesday's hearing featured a parade of drivers showing screenshots of their apps supporting their basic argument: They get paid far less than most riders realize, and their earnings have fallen steadily in recent years as the global rideshare companies take larger cuts of fares."
University of Minnesota,"It seems that then city council wants to run Uber/Lyft out of the city so those of us that can’t drive will be forced to use metro mobility, or the local taxi companies, which are unreliable for on demand rides. Or use the damn light rail and inhale some 2nd hand fentanyl smoke. 

And if we object, we are just blinded by a “false consensus” instilled by the ruling class and elites."
University of Minnesota,"It's amazing to me how otherwise ""liberal/left"" people get turned into laissez-faire capitalists when it comes to this issue

uber/lyft shouldn't have this stranglehold on our society and they should have to pay drivers fair wages."
University of Minnesota,"Call the bluff. If they leave they leave. Some drivers will go to traditional taxi companies, some might start their own company, some will work for a black car service, and some will get non-driving jobs. 

It wouldn’t be the end of the world."
University of Minnesota,"If I'm doing my math correctly.

They want Uber/Lyft drivers to average $35-$53/hr.

That cost transfers over to riders.

It doesn't seem like a realistic business model."
University of Minnesota,Has anyone been receiving insane amounts of promos from Uber lately? I wonder if it has anything to do with this ordinance.
University of Minnesota,"If you’re in a dorm, then no need for one. Even then, you can get most places with ride share, hour car rental, bicycles (and if you get an e-bike, you can carry groceries and stuff), mass transit or walking.  And then you don’t have to worry about parking, snow days, insurance, etc.

And welcome to the Cities!"
University of Minnesota,Ride a bike
University of Minnesota,"It's definitely not necessary. You can get anywhere you need to without a There is a Target Express in Dinkytown where you can get most essentials within walking distance. If you don't mind public transportation you'll have no issues getting around. The rideshare apps in the cities are also very reliable, fairly cheap and can get you where you need to go. 


However, if you plan to visit home frequently or need to drive outside of the cities a car can be very nice to have. It just gives you an additional level of freedom. However, parking on campus at the University lots is expensive and you have to be lucky enough to be selected for the parking lottery. 


Depending on where you live on campus, you can find monthly parking options, but this typically costs ~$100 a month. Some of the houses and older apartment complexes can have cheaper parking options. If you use your car frequently enough, street parking in the surrounding neighborhoods can be doable but can be very inconvenient in the winter months. This also depends on what area you live in. Como and Marcy Holmes will be better for parking. When I lived in Marcy Holmes (a neighborhood within walking distance of campus) I parked on the street and it was manageable, but I also drove to work most days so it felt worth the hassle. (I also got a few parking tickets in this timeframe but still cheaper than campus parking)


If you are coming in as a freshman, I recommend sucking it up for your freshman year. Live the car free life, enjoy it. And then choose an apartment with off street parking the next year."
University of Minnesota,You’d save a ton of money by using a Uber o Lyft on the weekends to get to your gf’s house. The U has a transit pass integrated into their ID now and you can ride buses and light rail for free.
University of Minnesota,"Unnecessary to have one. I’ve been fine for 4 years! Transit is great, take advantage of it, the cost for Ubering places that you can’t get transit to is WAY cheaper than car maintenance and more importantly PARKING. Sooo expensive and such a hassle on the U campus"
University of Minnesota,The campus is very easy to get around and ride share will be your best bet. No need for a vehicle unless you're working off campus a ton
University of Minnesota,"I'm not even a student and I didn't have a car until COVID.  Between Metro Transit, friends, and Uber/Lyft, it's not a need here.

The only reason I bought a car during COVID is because I didn't feel safe taking the other options because I didn't want to get sick.  

For anything you need though, as a student, you will be fine."
Michigan State University,"Yep it’s safe, a lot of the drivers you get in EL are from Lansing anyways."
Michigan State University,My spouse drives Uber & Lyft overnights around campus. Very safe 🙂
Michigan State University,"I never had a bad experience with an Uber/Lyft driver during my time at MSU. The only time I wouldn’t count on a ride being available would be really early in the morning, like 3-4 am. Speaking from experience 🫠"
Michigan State University,I've even been able to find Ubers at 6:00 AM from the morning after (granted I had to wait a bit) but there's def drivers!
Michigan State University,"there are plenty of drivers out at that time.  and depending on the day and where you are, you could take the 1 bus.  it runs pretty late."
Michigan State University,"i’ve taken an uber 4 times, twice to/from the hospital and it was fine. another leaving a guys dorm- very nice old man, and then another time leaving a party. they always were respectful and safe"
Michigan State University,"It’s safe, just expensive! College town weekend nights during events = price rides"
Michigan State University,"Highly suggest looking at the bus routes, it’s only 60 cents one way for students, even if you only take it to get to the event and Uber back you’ll save a lot of money."
Michigan State University,"Its safe! If you live on campus too, you can call safe ride (8pm-2am) or night owl(2am-6am) and thats for sure safe as well"
Michigan State University,"The sub is a driver's sub and is not sponsored, endorsed, or officially monitored by Uber."
Michigan State University,I was there at MSU driving and I strongly believe the suspect could have used rideshare to get to Lake Lansing/Larch. The shooter also looks familiar. I hope they check to see if he had a rideshare account.
Michigan State University,"Ubers stance:

We completely care about you and your riders. 

If you refuse too many rides, you will be deactivated!

Uber is like the honey badger…. They don’t give a fuck."
Michigan State University,"Hey buddy,

  
Don't take an uber or cab. Use the Michigan Flyer or Grey hound buses. It is much much cheaper. Welcome to Michigan :)"
Michigan State University,"Welcome to michigan.  Detroit and msu are 1h 30m apart and uber cost will be very very very expensive for that distance. Like the other ppl said, look into bus options - there’s michigan flyer and greyhound as far as I know."
Michigan State University,"If you have a preplanned long trip that goes from one larger city to another then you should *definitely* look into bussing, everyone else is saying Michigan Flyer!

If two cities are sufficiently large there’s likely to be a market to schedule bus routes between them, Lansing and Detroit definitely fit that criteria. I know my brother took an Amtrak(?) train to Chicago from EL. Just always go with a scheduled mass transit route to save money!

The only reason you pay an Uber’s premium cost is because it’s on demand and for short distances, this is preplanned and very long and as such the game has changed."
Michigan State University,"I would not do either. I would fly into Lansing. See if you can get a flight from Detroit to Lansing. I’ve done that once. It’s a little puddle jumper of a plane but it will take you there. Then, use an Uber."
Michigan State University,"it’s better to take the flyers, an uber will be too expensive"
Michigan State University,"Uber/Lyft driver here. DTW to MSU (or vice versa) ranges from $115-150 depending on how busy it is when the ride is requested. 

I second what others have said, the Flyer is a great option unless you have money to burn."
Michigan State University,"Apparently there’s a sign up sheet for free transportation but for any other time use the Michigan flyer, sooo much cheaper than an Uber"
Michigan State University,"As an occasional rider (to/from the airport or Michigan Flyer), I'm almost always surprised how cheap the rides are. I can't understand how it's worth it for the drivers around here (besides game days)."
Michigan State University,"If you want to drive, usually the times of most demand are in the morning like 7:30-10  fares are usually 1.5x or 2x.  I use lyft or uber at least twice a week in the winter to get to work cause i don't want to deal with the buses or riding my bike.  Game days are of course very lucrative.  I've seen up to 7x surges."
Michigan State University,"How do you plan to not hit cyclists the way Uber did?

otherwise what's your margin of error - 7 per month only 77 per month only? And what if it's a child cyclist where do they fit in

Thanks 🙏 taking notes on your killer robots for a future medium article when you kill someone"
Michigan State University,"Replacing Drivers with autonomous Vehicules is not exactly what I would call ""preparing the future  workforce""."
Michigan State University,Debbie Downer Phx already has Autonomous cars on the road but we are pretty progressive. You can get a car with no driver to pick you up just like Uber
Michigan State University,"As the responses above have stated, Michigan Flyer is your best bet. I recently used it last weekend to get to Campus from DTW. There is wifi, a bathroom and it’s honestly a relaxing ride. I paid $32 for my ticket."
Michigan State University,mainly Michigan flyer; but sometimes it’s cheaper to buy a flight ticket starting from LAN with a stop at DTW; LAN is 20 mins Uber away from the campus.
Michigan State University,"I literally just got an Uber from downtown EL to Lansing right after the MSU basketball game today, cost $12 and was as speedy as if Covid never happened.  The dude did have a plastic wrap wall in between us and him, but I couldn’t tell if that was because of Covid or puking msu students.  He was nice too."
Michigan State University,"I have not had any issues working Lansing or East Lansing.  I live a few miles out of town and it’s been hit or miss if there a driver available for pickup. 

Edit: I only have the Uber app, never needed to have Lyft. Yet."
Michigan State University,"Just depends on your timing, but yes, drivers are definitely back."
Michigan State University,"yep!  sometimes it can take a while (like 20-25 minutes from asking for a ride to getting in a car) but you can get a ride.  i found sometimes that if lyft is taking a while, uber is faster and vice-versa, but not always."
Michigan State University,"Google two party consent states. If Michigan is two party, you have to post notices. Post notices anyway.

Lyft doesn't care. Uber will let you register the cam and will inform pax that you have one."
Michigan State University,"Also, look up laws regarding expectation of privacy and whether that applies in a rideshare situation."
Michigan State University,I'm looking for a driver right now... but it doesn't seem like anyone is available.
Michigan State University,"I’ve seen an Uber cost around $150 one way from Detroit to Lansing, the flyer is def the cheapest and probably most convenient option but do be careful about late arriving flights as I believe the flyer stops after a certain time of night"
Michigan State University,"use the flyer as you can schedule and guarantee a ride (no worry outside of winter) and it takes you right to your terminal for I think $50 round trip. keep in mind late night runs. if you’re aching to save money, you can always sleep in DTW until the flyer begins its run"
Michigan State University,I use metro car pricey but drivers are professional and they track ur In bound flight and the drivers are reliable
Michigan State University,you could just bum a ride to the nearest train station and take it up to lansing
UMich,It will say in the app in express drive section. I don't use it but I looked at it before and the cheapest rental in my area is $44 for 120 rides week it's probably around the same number of rides.
UMich,"The short answer is no, it's not reliable. 

The reservation system is terrible for riders and drivers alike. For airport rides from Ann Arbor, a scheduled ride will pay the driver roughly ~$30.00.  Drivers are required to be online 40 minutes before the scheduled time and the system forces them to arrive there 15 minutes prior to the departure time. If the rider is ready to leave, that can work out great but otherwise the driver has to sit there (earning no extra money because $30 is a flat fee). 

The entire reservation system is a money loser for drivers. First, you are giving up any rides that you can give during the 25ish minutes prior to departure time of the scheduled ride. Second, taking a reservations mean you are locked in to that flat fee. If there is a surge (which there often is) during the early morning hours, you will lose out on that. For an example, drivers can get an airport ride in the morning with a surge that will pay out $50+ while those who took the reservations will be stuck with only $30. 

As a result of all this, drivers rarely take reservation rides. But the app gives the impression to riders that their reservations have been matched with a driver when that is usually not the case. In turn, riders rely on having a ride when they probably don't which is terrible for them. In the end, if your reservation isn't matched, you will just be part of the regular request pool but the availability of drivers that early in the morning does not meet the requests hence the high surges."
UMich,I wouldn’t do it. I’ve had an scheduled Uber early in the morning and had to scramble to find a black car to drive me to the airport because my Uber that I had scheduled the day before didn’t show up and Uber has no way to resolve this problem so early in the morning. They tend to be very few drivers available before the morning commute time.
UMich,"Maybe we got lucky compared to others, but We have pre-scheduled rides two times in the past 6 months at 3:30a-4a. Both were Lyft. Once for me, once for my wife, for early morning flights. Both times, the driver was in our driveway at the exact time we scheduled."
UMich,"I wouldn't do it. The only time I've successfully been able to schedule airport rides that early is in much bigger cities, as there's generally more availability, so if your scheduled driver doesn't show up, there will be a few backup options. 

I think spending a little more money and scheduling with a dedicated airport shuttle company/person is better for anything before 8am. We've used [Air One Transportation](https://airportonetransportation.com/locations/detroit-michigan-dtw/) for years and never have had issues with Richard. I know others also have their preferred company/people and will drop their recs ITT."
UMich,"We had a driver take the fair, show up, and demand an additional $100. Thankfully we were able to drive ourselves and pay for the parking because at that point it was cheaper."
UMich,"This is such a big concern for people I’m pretty surprised. 

Lyft has taken me to DTW and from DTW several times and I almost always fly red eye and such. It’s just easier to get through airports then. 

I had one instance where I had an Uber cancel on me during a daytime need. I had a tire blow and needed to pick it up but honestly I lost my tire on my road and so I wasn’t mad, but Uber just assigns you another driver. What happens is eventually a bonus comes up for a driver to just go and do it so the fare gets grabbed fairly quickly. The loss of a user due to a poor experience of no availability in a busy area is far greater than the company can afford due to it being a giant cash sink already. 

I have better fares with Lyft and I’m a poor planner so I’ll just open the app about an hour before I need to be at the airport but there are at least 3 major taxi services for airport commuting in the area as well."
UMich,For what it’s worth I go to the airport a lot (3 times a month) and always use UBER at all hours. I always use Comfort and make a reservation ahead of time. Never once been let down
UMich,"This entire program is just another Lyft marketing campaign. I’ve watched people who got these rides, got the job were provided with ride credits for a month and a good number of them ended up getting fired. Why, because Lyfts unreliable and it all comes down to how they manage the drivers who are supposed to be independent contractors. How they cheat drivers on pay especially for scheduled rides which is what the majority of these rides will fall under more than than people discover that even if Lyft does these things an it is initially viewed as beneficial. The harsh reality is that these people  after the ride credit period was over, found themselves now paying out half their income to Lyft simply to go to work and home. No real chance to better their situation. Lyft uses these programs as a means to gain users. And these programs are largely targeted at helping minorities. How are you actually helping them by helping them get a job just so you can pay them half your money and have so little money your options are still just as limited, but Lyfts now getting paid. Lyft effectively dry pimps the drivers. And this is a not so different way to make sure the riders are left with no real other option. Being broke, it changes the way you think. Everything is a decision where your very survival is on the line. You are forced to make quick decisions that train you only look at the short term. Becoming increasingly more difficult to take a step back and view the big picture and think and plan long term. Lyft is absolutely exploiting this."
UMich,And they will make sure you wind up 5 minutes late so you don't get the job and wind up driving for Lyft.
UMich,"What Lyft is doing is a pure PR marketing scheme in order to promote themselves as a ""good"" company that cares for the poor and marginalized people."
UMich,If you can’t afford a ride in San Francisco you probably have much bigger problems than getting to an interview.
UMich,Fuck lyft bitch ass fags. Keep banning my throwaway all u want ill keep coming back. You wrong for posting that girls info
UMich,FK rideshare companies

UMich,You get job offers and opportunities from just picking up strangers…why would i get lyft involved? Is this their way of getting rid of drivers in certain areas?
UMich,"Lyft share... Good opportunty

Lyft posted second-quarter earnings on Tuesday. The company reported quarterly sales of $1.02 billion which met the analyst consensus estimate, a 3.05% increase over sales of $990.75 million the same period last year.

Lyft also issued guidance, anticipating third-quarter revenue in the range of $1.13 billion and $1.15 billion, versus the $1.09 billion estimate.

On Wednesday, the stock fell over 9% in response to Tuesday's earnings report. Also, several analysts updated their price targets on the stock.

Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju maintained Lyft with a Outperform and lowered the price target from $23 to $18.
DA Davidson analyst Tom White reiterated Lyft with a Neutral and raised the price target from $9.75 to $11.5.
RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson maintained Lyft with a Sector Perform and raised the price target from $9 to $12.
Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil maintained Lyft with a Neutral and raised the price target from $9 to $10."

UMich,Lyft is left over of Uber and worse
UMich,"Service in town is fine, I’ve never had trouble getting a ride. Getting to Pinckney *might* be an issue, are there no other guests they can ride with?"
UMich,I use Uber/Lyft a lot since I have some mobility issues so I can't really walk far enough for public transit sometimes. As long as it's not very odd hours you generally won't have an issue. You may have to wait a bit since the town is pretty spread out but i almost never have an issue. Lyft seems to generally have more availability for whatever it's worth.
UMich,"It's not a big issue. There is also the bus system (theride.org), which I've found to be fairly reliable."
UMich,I don’t Uber or Lyft regularly but I don’t think it’s been an issue here? If you’re visiting soon Umich is on spring break so A2 feels kind of empty right now anyways with everyone gone home or on vacation
UMich,I used Lyft on Monday without any issues. Took a little longer than normal to get a ride.
UMich,"I Uber all the time from the airport to A2, you’ll be fine. Apps lie about how quickly they’ll come but not by too much. Dexter maybe harder, idk. 

This weekend my driver said if school is not in session (like last week’s holiday) then most drivers will decline to drive to A2 bc it’s hard to pick up a new ride. 

An alternative is the take the Michigan Flyer for $15 from each terminal to downtown A2. It’s a coach bus. Tickets available online. I’ve done it a couple times it’s just the timing isn’t often convenient."
UMich,"[LAAD Transportation](https://laadtransportation.com) is cheaper than Uber or Lyft which often cost about $55-$65+ from DTW to Ann Arbor one way. You can reserve your own driver for $45 with LAAD. I haven’t used them, but I know several people who have and really liked it."
UMich,It depends where in a2 but if downtown or campus probably pretty easy.  Also good bus service usually.  If a campus you can also pick up michigan blue busses for free.  Uber and lift are a lot less available when you start to get out of the core area.  If you know where you are coming from or going to just plug it in and see.  There are some good car services that are going to be more reliable from dtw.
UMich,"I’ve gotten rides cancelled a few times from the airport to ypsi.  A kind driver who finally took me told me that airport rides *from* the airport to a quieter location aren’t as good, because it’s less likely they’ll get a good ride once they get there.   But people like taking rides to the airport because they’ll get another good ride again. 

I always get home eventually but like 1/3 of the time someone bails and its annoying.  This would be most likely to happen if you’re headed to dexter, least likely with Ann Arbor (biggest town). 

Depending on your situation, if you really want reliability, arrange with a driver you find online, like metro cars"
UMich,You'll get better answers from the other sub. All we see from the Lyft driver's end is high maintenance riders who couldn't tip if they wanted to. I don't think that anyone has officially told us that it's even a thing.
UMich,"It may be an add-on to your father's Medicare plan or you may already have it. You'll want to reach out to them to see if you're eligible. You won't actually be requesting the rides through Lyft yourself. You call Medicare and tell them that you need a ride, and they set it up.  


Edit: I'm a driver. I give these rides a few times a week."
UMich,"Just call your state Medicaid and\ or health insurance (Molina, priority healt etc) and say you need help getting to your medical appointments and they'll give you the number to set them up. Access2care transportation is who they're using now at least in Michigan through my Molina Healthcare. I'm on SSI and Medicaid in Michigan. I can even get rides to Ann arbor Michigan from Grand Rapids Michigan(across the state). Good luck. You can even get gas reimbursement if you can drive or someone else can drive. Also if you're in the city they'll also give you bus passes. It's extremely helpful when you can't find a way to your really important appointments."
UMich,Because lack of drivers in Novi. Well… maybe not anymore now that you’ve invited everyone. The battery convention was this week so major surges there.
UMich,"I've done both! They were both pretty much the same experience. In the middle of the day you shouldn't have any problems hailing an Uber/Lyft.

The taxi service I used was Stadium Taxi because they were cheaper than an Uber/Lyft. I actually had to call them last second the morning of a flight because 6am was too early to get an Uber/Lyft. They were at my door in 30 minutes, but you can also schedule in advance. This was post-corona too, so they're still definitely operating. 

[https://www.stadiumtaxi.com/](https://www.stadiumtaxi.com/)"
UMich,"Oh dip I thought you said 3 AM.  You said 3:00 PM.  There should be no shortage of uber drivers around that time.  If you want a shuttle service, you can consider that too, although some are still temporarily shut down:

UMich,"Reservations, reservations, reservations. Make sure you make reservations. So much has changed since the pandemic began. Many gig workers quit or found new jobs. Most rideshare drivers want to stay safe and are delivering food now only. The taxi and limo services are your best, and should be the only, option to think of for any important ride arrangements. Before the pandemic Uber and Lyft left people high and dry looking for rides at the last minute. We had to save the day for so many back then. It’s really getting old hearing about it now. It’s 100 times worse after the pandemic eased up, no one is really out working like before. Most rideshare drivers want fast money and surge prices. They sit back and wait to see red zones & don’t really care for the job. Call a service that cares about their reputation and customer satisfaction. Taxi and limo company prices are often slightly different but steady at the same rates each time you book. https://premiertaxiandlimo.com/ann-arbor-taxi-near-me/"
UMich,I have used an Uber/Lyft to get to the airport many times and had a positive experience. I believe in both apps you can schedule rides so you could reserve your ride ahead of time.
UW Madison,"I took an Uber around 4:30AM in mid-April and found a driver quickly. Had tried booking a cab through Union the day before but they had no availability

I was definitely nervous all night that I'd get a ride so you have to factor that in. Would have gladly paid double for the peace of mind of a guaranteed ride"
UW Madison,"I've been able to schedule a Green Cab beforehand for early early flights - less early ones I actually prefer taking the bus out there, it's longer but going from downtown to the airport for the low low cost of ""I have a bus pass"" is p great.

My suggestion: try scheduling a taxi, and if (like the other commenter) they don't have availability, then go for an Uber/Lyft. It might actually be cheaper to get a real cab, tbh"
UW Madison,My scheduled Ubers have always showed up at the earliest time frame if not earlier for me. I have also called an Uber at 4 am before and they showed up in 5 mins.
UW Madison,"I scheduled ahead for a Lyft to be picked up at around 4:30am to go to the airport once. I did it in advance because I was worried there wouldn't be any Lyfts around at that time. I don't know when they send out the request for the ride as I got the notification that someone accepted my ride request the night before. They arrived about 10 minutes earlier than I requested which worked out fine for me as I was already good to go. My friend who was riding with me checked Uber/Lyft while we were going and this guy was the only one active. In fact, another group we were meeting at the airport had to wait for him to finish our ride before they could get picked up."
UW Madison,"it’s a hit or miss. i usually stay at a friend’s house (close to campus like on university ave) till around that time. sometimes i find a driver but they’re usually far away (have to wait for around 10 to 15 minutes). sometimes i don’t find a driver though and i end up walking home.
the schedule ahead feature is useless if you’re planning a trip during a time when usually there are no or very little drivers. i’d definitely recommend booking a cab or taxi if you have to be somewhere at that time since it’s a much safer bet even though it’s a tad more expensive."
UW Madison,"I'm an alum and I use Uber whenever I visit Madison even though I know it's illegal. The cabs were always terrible when I was on campus. Took forever or never showed up. My remaining friends in Madison still complain about the same stuff and have switched to Uber. I am in that group of people who just want to get across town. It's mainly about service. That being said, I would gladly choose the local cab companies and even pay more over using Uber if the cabs provided something close to the level of service I get when I use Uber, but it's not even close. Frankly, often in Madison it's like they don't even want my business. I don't know if they are going to take forever or just not show up when I'm trying to get to the airport or to a meeting. This is especially true if I need to call one on the fly that I haven't pre-scheduled. I understand they may be busy, but I still need to get across town.

I also have to say that the argument about safety seems a little disingenuous to me. I have definitely felt a lot less safe in cabs then I have during my experiences with Uber drivers. The cab insurance issue is also not going to move me when I'm trying to get to the airport on time. I freely admit to being pro-Uber right now, but honestly I would love to support the local cabs. Maybe things have changed and I need to give them another shot. Basically, at this time the Uber service simply seems so superior to me that I will readily break the law to use it over the Madison cab companies."
UW Madison,"I don't *want* to be a dick, because I like activism and try to promote it on principle.

But Uber and Lyft are pretty damn great services."
UW Madison,"I have changed my mind on the subject of whether or not these services should be allowed. If you are willing to put yourself at risk as either driver or rider, go for it. Just realize what you're getting yourself into and accept the consequences. I feel most sober people will continue to choose licensed cabs.
Personally I would much rather see these cab companies using the same technology. What's stopping Green Cab, Union Cab, Badger Cab, and Madison Taxi from being trackable on an app? "
UW Madison,I’ve found that Lyft is generally cheaper than Uber. If it’s during surge times Green Cab can actually be cheaper sometimes and I think they also have an app
UW Madison,Cab every time. Drivers making a living wage is important.
UW Madison,"Woman here, I hate cabs with a passion. Lyft and Uber are both fine, just check both to see which is cheaper before you pick one. Drivers can’t drive if their rating drops below a 3.0, so most drivers are pleasant to ride with. You’ll get the occasional crazy or bad driver, but I haven’t seen any since moving here and I exclusively use Lyft or Uber to get around when I’m not biking."
UW Madison,"I ran into this problem over the weekend. I was trying to go from downright to the East Towne area at about 1 am Friday night (Saturday morning). That's usually a $15 trip on Uber. At that time, it was reading $60. (Which I thought was ridiculous considering none of the bars in the area were that busy, so the demand couldn't have been that high.) I looked at the Union Cab app, and they were reading $35. I mentally said no to both, so I started walking down East Wash.

I ended up walking all the down to First before the surge broke on Uber ($15). When I looked on UC, it was still reading $23. It was reading $25 at Festival, whereas Uber was still reading ~$40/45. Right now (1 pm, Tuesday afternoon), going from East Towne to downtown costs $15 on Uber, $28 on UC.

Conclusion: Cabs will generally have a lower price ceiling during high-traffic times/areas, but Uber/Lyft have a lower price floor."
UW Madison,"Lyft was cheaper than Green Cab in August. But, I ended up going with Green Cab because I could actually schedule it in advance and get a reliable window of when to expect someone. When I tried to schedule a morning ride in advance with Lyft, there was a 40-minute ""maybe you will be picked up"" window. It was $17 (not including tip) to go from downtown to (near) MATC with Green Cab or $14 (no tip) with Lyft.  The trip wasn't cheap but I didn't want to take my cat on the bus, lol.  I also felt a little better using a local company rather than Uber/Lyft which doesn't treat their employees well. 

If you ride the bus, you should definitely have a mask. I still see people getting on without.  I also think it is worth taking hand sanitizer with you since you will touch common areas."
UW Madison,"When I need to use it, I prefer to use Uber. It's less expensive than using the cab. 

I can't say how Lyft compares, but either of those are always better than the cab."
UW Madison,"uber and lyft are typically cheaper than a cab. the price between uber and lyft is typically pretty similar, unless one is surging and the other isn’t. regarding safety, i personally prefer lyft. i’ve always seemed to have better drivers and better overall experiences with lyft."
UW Madison,"If you have a smart phone and link them both to google maps, I believe you can compare the costs of Uber vs Lyft for a specific ride. Search for directions in google maps for your destination and you should be able to select a tab that will show both prices, or at least a cost range."
UW Madison,"A lot of drivers drive for both. I once asked a guy driving if he had a preference and he said ""nah, you should just go with whatevers cheaper."""
UW Madison,"Personally, I prefer Lyft, but I just order from whichever one is cheaper at the time!"
UW Madison,i’ve used uber many times and have never had an issue
UW Madison,"I'd go with the one that offers current pictures of the drivers. I took an Uber several months ago and the driver had a big beard and affable, hearty laugh.  Would have been a pleasant drive in normal times but since his mask didn't seal anything I could imagine the virus being sprayed back at me through his beard each time he chortled.  Also, at one time I read Lyft was equipping some drivers with plexiglass walls, don't know if that happened in Madison but would definitely be a plus to be isolated from each other."
UW Madison,Check each app before every ride. The answer is that it varies
UW Madison,"For scheduled rides Uber requires the driver to be online 45 minutes before the ride, and won’t give them any other rides during that time period.  That is what you are paying for with a scheduled ride."
UW Madison,"Weirdly enough, for a while I found Lyft was massively more expensive than Uber here. I usually just check both each time I need a ride since I never know which one is fleecing me otherwise."
UW Madison,"Supply and demand. Sometimes you can't even get a ride with one or the other. I have both and always check both, for pricing and wait times"
UW Madison,"Lyft is consistently cheaper than uber whenever I try to use a ride service, either at home or on vacation"
UW Madison,"Capitalism. 

Each service has a certain number of drivers and competing demand at any given time."
UW Madison,"Both platforms offer quotes before actually matching the driver to the rider.  You likely would have waited a lot longer for the Lyft ride than the Uber ride. The Lyft ride may never have come, and could have gotten repriced before you could actually get picked up."
UW Madison,nah you just schedule uber/lyft. They will be available. I have flought out of Dane at 5-7 am and have always taken uber/lyft
UW Madison,"Two things:

Union Cab is super reliable. Schedule one.

Ask around closer to your flight. Chances are there will be other people flying out who you may be able to catch a ride with.

But if you're posting to ease your mind, Union Cab is great. I've used them countless times since 2000 and I've never had an issue at any time of day."
UW Madison,I’m a junior who has flown out of MSN for various reasons probably 20+ times… used Uber or Lyft every single time and never had an issue.
UW Madison,I’ve gotten an Uber at 6am before. Might be a bit of a wait but should be fine
UW Madison,I’ve just scheduled an uber or lyft in advanced and never had an issue
UW Madison,I use Uber and it’s always worked
UW Madison,"I only did it for a total of around 120 hours for Uber, but I averaged around $12-15. Bar time one night I made $40 per for two hours, but by the time I made my last drop off at 3:45a, I was 35 mins from Madison. "
UW Madison,"I did Lyft as a supplemental job for a few months - some stray observations:

- only peak hours for Lyft are weekday mornings, Friday/Saturday nights, or during major events (Epic UGM, Dairy Expo, Badger football games). If you can't drive those hours, forget about getting any bonuses

- airport is not worth the wait in most cases, since cabs are allowed to line up, while rideshares have to sit in the cell phone lot. Waiting 30 minutes for a ride that may only net you $10 isn't worth it.

- bar time can be profitable, but holy crap driving on University/Johnson/Gorham near campus is dangerous. There's no safe spots to pull over on the major roads except for that block in front of Karaoke Kid/Double U. 

- You're better off picking a spot on either the west side, taking hotel guests to and from downtown, or on the east side, as it tends to be under-served by drivers

- In short, if you need some cash, there are worse gigs, but don't expect much.

- FYI the best night I ever had was the night of The Chainsmokers concert at the Alliant center. It was a perfect mix of a Friday night, during rush hour, and it was pouring rain. From 3:30-6 pm I did nothing but drive carloads of UW kids to the arena, all on a 2x surge or better. After the concert, between 9-11 pm, I got two rides back to campus at 5x and 6x. I raked in $350 over five hours of driving. But that was a HUGE outlier, and I never got anything half that good again."
UW Madison,"Usually around $15/hour. I’d imagine drivers who drive during bar hours might earn more, but I’m not willing to deal with the drunk frat bros on State St. "
UW Madison,"Before moving to Madison I would Uber (Lyft a little) and I made decent supplemental income. Nothing to survive on. But my city was about 25% University so there was always demand. After moving to Madison I tried it for a little but over Christmas break when I was off work. Wasn’t what I was expecting from a city with 10x the population. I made about $15/hr.  Not worth it in my opinion, I’ll take my free time. I tried the airport, you might wait 30 minutes for a 30 minute ride and then made $15. Out of 4 rides I did one day, I got $6 in tips I think. Nothing spectacular. "
UW Madison,"I drove when both first came into Madison, and was an “ambassador” for Lyft.  That meant I was part of a small group that on boarded new drivers.  I’m not sure if they still do this or if it has become automated, but look into the training / recruitment aspect.

Basically when someone wanted to become a driver, you would get a notification.  They would drive to you and you’d do things like show them how to use the app, take their photo, take photos of their car, etc.  The process took about 30-45 mins and I believe you got $75 each time if I remember correctly.

Additionally, if I recruited someone - say one of my passengers wanted to become a driver.  I’d set up the training with them and get the $75, then if they stuck with it and completed x amount of rides in the first month, you’d get something like $250-$500.

So doing the actual driving, I’d estimate about $15 net an hour like others mentioned, but I made the most money with very little time or effort through the training program.

Like I said, they may have gone away from this program, but maybe worth asking about."
UW Madison,Be aware that this week is Epic UGM so there's going to be a LOT of people visiting the area. It might be harder to get a Lyft/Uber or Cab in general.
UW Madison,Prebook a Lyft. That way you're almost guaranteed to have a ride.
UW Madison,"For early morning stuff, Union Cab is the most reliable. I’ve pre-booked Lyfts and Ubers for morning airport drives and have had rides cancelled or had them not find a car. Union Cab’s app is easy to prebook or just call. If you’re looking for something where you absolutely have to be somewhere at a certain time like a flight or a surgery, I think that’s the safest bet. 

Ubers and Lyfts really did change the game for bar time transportation, though. I think most of the taxi haters (and I’ve been one of them) come from the 2000-early 2010s era when you’d call a cab outside the bar and it would take forever to show up or it wouldn’t show up at all (that was Madison Taxi’s specialty.) And then if you didn’t have cash and had to do a card, the cab driver would be a prick about it. Cabs are better for some things, rideshare is better for others. I’ve had mostly negative experiences with Green Cab (app crashing, rides cancelled, drivers being assholes) so they’re last on my lists."
UW Madison,"Prebook a cab.  Sometimes there’s an Uber available at that time, sometimes not."
UW Madison,Never had a problem getting a Uber home from a friends house after a night of drinking so I’d assume you’re fine
UW Madison,"I’m definitely biased as an Uber driver, but I drive from 3am-7am regularly and I’m almost never the only Madison Uber driver online, even at 4am. The airport rush starts around 4:45am so by 6am the road is usually plenty saturated with drivers.

If you do go with rideshare, and you’re concerned about getting a driver, schedule ahead of time. They will match a driver to you about 20-30m before the appointment. Yes, the driver can cancel on you and not show, but if they do, they’ll probably do it right when they get the request (not right before you’re walking out the door) and you will be priority #1 for Uber in terms of sending the next available driver- who is probably not far. I’ve probably done 250 early morning scheduled rides, and on all but 2 of them, Uber sent me early enough to get there before the scheduled departure time- even accounting for previous drivers who accepted the trip and then cancelled before I picked it up."
UW Madison,"I drive ft for Uber. Schedule the day before with what time you want. They will get you a driver for the pickup. Myself and another driver I know are out in those early times and do these often. Just if you reserve, plz be ready before the scheduled arrival time as sometimes they get us there too early and we don't really get paid to wait"
UW Madison,Prebook a ride on Uber or Lyft.  Be ready 20 minutes before the scheduled time.  I have picked up many people that said they were stood up by the cab company that early in the morning.  There are no guarantees.
UW Madison,I’d say you’re good with an Uber but absolutely 0% change with Lyft
UW Madison,"The last time I had a very late flight I did not plan ahead and ended up waiting 45 minutes for a cab. The few Ubers that were out kept canceling my trips, and union cab had a long wait. 

Either schedule it *immediately* upon landing or call ahead."
UW Madison,Why wouldn’t it be safe to ride a taxi or rideshare service from the airport to campus?
UW Madison,"I lived in Seattle for the last year and I used Lyft all the time. It's cheaper, faster, and a generally better experience than a cab. Madison is much smaller than Seattle, so it will be interesting to see if Lyft is as successful here as it is in larger cities."
UW Madison,"Two questions - 
1) No cash exchanges hands, does it mean the customer doesn't have to tip the driver?
2) I've heard of Uber before, and this seems similar. How does Lyft compare to Uber?"
UW Madison,[Lyft](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNM7Z7hir_I) can be fun!
UW Madison,"For those of you still lingering on this.

I reached out to lyfts press team. They state that they have purchased social media ads targeting over 20 different cities (including Madison) just to test the waters.

I wouldn't get my hopes up."
UW Madison,"If you wan't a free or cheap ride use promo code **HMDPDL** after your first Lyft to save $10.  If you are interested in driving, sign-up [here.](http://lft.to/1gXFsz2)  You may already be able to request a Lyft in Madison, but don't be discouraged if it doesn't match you with a driver.  It hasn't quite officially rolled out, but there are a few drivers out there certified."
UW Madison,If you want to download the app and give it a try you can use my code JUSTIN3965 and get $25 in free Lyft credits.  Just use it in the promo box of the payment section.
UW Madison,"Lyft is currently suspended from operating in Madison Wisconsin.  When you exchange money for the service of transportation, you still need to have a comercial permit in a lot of US cities.  Madison happens to be one such city.  We do not have a medallion cab system here.  this is a free enterprise system where anyone can own/operate a cab if they pay very small and reasonable fees for a permit and training.  If Lyft and uber wanted to make headway in madison, why did they try charging 20% more than the two shared ride services already in madison?"
University of Dayton,"I waited 55 minutes on a Saturday for an uber from Oakwood to Centerville / Alex Bell.  Cost 40$ lol.

Can't say I was impressed with ubers here sadly.  Unreliable and pricey."
University of Dayton,Hard to predict.  If you're talking after the airport closes there won't be many around the area.  You could test it by waking up and looking up rides through the next week to see how many cars are around.
University of Dayton,"How is your employer expecting you to get to work if they aren’t getting you a rental car?

Anyway, I agree with others that rides aren’t super reliable late at night here, downtown sure but the airport doesn’t have a ton of flights throughout the day and Uber drivers can easily check the schedule and only show up when a plane lands etc.

However, DAY does have a free airport-operated taxi service that goes city-wide. You may want to contact the airport about that.

Where will you be working at the airport? Inside or outside of security? Inside of security you’ll require credentials. Are you working construction on the ramp? That’ll require SIDA credentials. Because of these credentials I would think the airport taxi would be able to help you on a schedule even though you’re not taking a flight. Worth a shot."
University of Dayton,During the late fall and winter months you wont find an uber outside of very large events after 10pm. Dont rely on them if you can.
University of Dayton,COVID killed ride sharing in Dayton. Before the pandemic hit I used Uber in the area all the time and I'd normally only have to wait 5-10 minutes for a car. It's very different now and who knows if it will recover eventually or not.
University of Dayton,It took me an hour to find a Lyft driver the other night. Asked about it and he said most of them switched to doordash and other things like that when the pandemic started because they can make more money doing that.
University of Dayton,"I'd love to drive for Uber/ Lyft, but my car is too old, even though I keep-up on it well. So door dash it is."
University of Dayton,"Even scheduling ahead of time, you are taking your chances for a 2am ride to the airport from the suburbs.  If you are downtown your chances improve.

On a side note, I gave up on them.  I've used them maybe five times to get home from the airport.  In every instance, the car was an absolute shitbox.  In one instance, the seatbelt didn't work.  In another, the whole backseat was stained, with, something.

I just park in the Economy lot ($5 a day)."
University of Dayton,"I did this on Christmas for 3:45/4 am to go to Cincinnati airport. Scheduled a Lyft a day or so prior and it was accepted. Then the morning of I was waiting for the driver and the time passed. Lyft still had me wait but I was able to get refunded. They initially tried to find me another driver but were unsuccessful. 

Luckily I was able to get an Uber pretty fast. 

Scheduling doesn’t really guarantee you have a ride."
University of Dayton,If you want to hear some actual stories from two drivers in Dayton OH. My wife and I run a podcast over at [sidehustlekerfuffle.com](https://sidehustlekerfuffle.com) and we discuss stories and then at the end of every episode we discuss our hours and the amount of money we made that week. You could always skip to the end to see what we've been making weekly and the hours we're putting in to do so. I'd say a rough estimate before gas and wear and tear on the vehicle... DoorDash is somewhere between $9-$12/hr and Uber/Lyft is somewhere between $15-$21 per hour in the Dayton market (currently) and again... This is before gas and wear and tear.
University of Dayton,You can get a fare estimate for [Uber](https://www.uber.com/fare-estimate/) of [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/fare-estimate). The cheapest option I'm seeing is $80.42 for Uber and $70-$80 for Lyft from CVG to the Dayton Mall. The actual cost will vary though.
University of Dayton,"My co-worker had the mobile # for an Uber driver that would take him to the Columbus airport fairly often. Also took him to CVG a couple of times. I'm sure there are drivers that will do it as long as the one-way fare covers them enough 'cause there's little to no odds that they'll get a rider going back the same way. Then again, they could get a rider going to some part of western Columbus to justify it.

The driver I'm referring to may not still be doing Uber though. It was 2+ years ago. 

What you could try is reserve an Uber early enough that allows you a back-up plan in case no one responds. If that driver does, tell him/her you need this same ride/trip routinely and if you can contact them directly. Might be against Uber or Lyft's rules but that's between you two...."
University of Dayton,A co worker of mine uber's and goes to cincy often and would do it probably. Hed probably do it for the fare cost of uber and cut uber out. I dont know if that helps but he's drive down there a lot. He took someone from cvg to Indy last week 
University of Dayton,"I used to drive for Uber. I don't think any driver will turn you down. I believe, at least with Uber, they are notified that the ride will be a ""long fare"" upon notification. I've taken people to CVG and Columbus and had no complaints other than having to drive back and not have any fares, but that was before Uber allowed all drivers in Ohio cities to be cross fictional between cities. I gave my personal info to a few riders who wanted a reliable person, so that's a relationship you can easily find as you do it more. 

My advice would just request the ride and send a message to the driver before they arrive where you are going, then they can cancel the ride early as opposed to being suprised by your long ride when they arrive. But again, I personally don't think many drivers will hesitate to a fare like that. 

Edit: I know with Lyft you can preschedule a ride drivers and opt into a ride ahead of time, it's shows the driver ahead of time the dollar amount for the ride so they know it will be long if the fare is high before accepting. "
University of Dayton,"I used to fly about 3-4x a month and took uber/lyft. If you are looking for an uber before 7am, you'll have to make sure to schedule it ahead of time especially if its sunday and expect to pay $90-140. I've had times where there were no uber drivers between 4-6am.

You're better off driving if you have a car and doing the economy/long term parking (~$10/day) at CVG or an offsite parking service (<$5/day). Both will shuttle you in and it might take 2 minutes waiting for the shuttle and 5 minutes to get to the terminal."
University of Dayton,"Depending on how long your trip is it might be cheaper, or equal, to driving yourself and parking your car. The cheapest parking lot at cvg is $9/day. Never had a problem with it. I would easily say an Uber will be $90+.. consider both ways. I think you’d be better off driving yourself unless you don’t have a car. And besides that, being in control of when you leave and arriving back and not having to wait for an Uber"
University of Dayton,"Curious, what’s it cost to park your car at CVG?

I’m curious if the price it would take to have an Uber there and back to Dayton would be more than just driving your car parking it there during the trip"
University of Dayton,"[https://www.uber.com/global/en/price-estimate/](https://www.uber.com/global/en/price-estimate/)

Bout a hundred bucks.. tip well!"
University of Dayton,Parking is super cheap so I would just do that rather than uber...Or have a friend drive you
University of Dayton,I just returned from a trip this past weekend and my Uber from CVG to Dayton was $98 and change. That's about what it was on the way there too. Someone else parked their car for two weeks there and the total cost was about $270-280 or so. (\~$20/day).
University of Dayton,Next time get a private car service more reliable than Lyft/Uber hacks
University of Dayton,"Use a chauffeur service or xl black car service,, you are using the cheapest rideshare service and then complain, it doesn't matter if the driver sat on it for days and canceled,  if lyft really cared they would have up the pay high enough so that you would have had drivers scrambling to take your fare as soon as it was sent out but they don't care, if they can't make a 50 to 70 percent profit on your ride then the hell with you they have millions of other riders to meet their margins. Please use other services for time critical rides ,I know I would."
University of Dayton,"You might have paid $90 but the driver might have only been getting $9.   And that could be why the drivers didn't do your trip.  This is how rideshare works now in 2023.  You pay a craxzy amount, the driver gets a ridiculously low amount which covers gas and then is barely minimum wage and then the company gets rich (well actually they use accounting tricks to then claim they are broke after taking in $20 billion..but you get the picture) 

And when drivers point out that the low pay is why there are all these service problems riders like yourself typically get very upset and down vote them and say something like ""Don't like it?  Get another job""

But really, like it or not, it's the company who is ultimately responsible for this.  Don't shoot the messenger, eh?"
University of Dayton,"Original Poster is confusing what the customer pays to Lyft with what Lyft pays to the driver.  Of that ninety bananas, the driver sees thirty eight on a good day.  There is more than one reason why people call it ""Gr**yft**"".

If drivers had ""all power"", we would not be getting paid 1976 cab rates."
University of Dayton,"No, there is no way you can report a driver who never drove you. Nor should there be, Karen. Find another ride."
University of Dayton,"If you’re in a smaller place like Greenville SC, use a taxi. Uber and Lyft is not the best to use.

- A Greenville resident"
University of Dayton,"Your bad review should be for Lyft the company on Twitter. It has absolutely nothing to do with the individual drivers who did not provide a ride and were under no obligation to do so, even if they wanted to. Your issue is 100% with the company (Uber too) that doesn’t care enough to assure that scheduled rides work the way most people would expect."
University of Dayton,"When I got to your ""all the power to the drivers"" may I suggest you try signing up and doing this for a while. You will see drivers have much less power other than being able to reject rides.

Now you may have run into a driver who have it out for Lyft and did it on purpose. He could have had some kind of emergency. he could have gotten a better ride on Uber. However, just because you pay $90 does not mean it all goes to the driver.

There really is nothing you can do but move on in life and put it in your past. next time schedule an Uber and Lyft and the first one to get there wins."
University of Dayton,"You can’t review someone that performed no services.  We are independent contractors.   Not employees.  Which is why we are paid crap and why you didn’t have a for sure ride.  
Bad reviews.  That’s your whole point of this??  
A scheduled ride is NOT a guarantee.  
And $90 USD.  Is that what you were being charged by lyft?? Caii oh se u guarantee thats not what driver earned.  
We earn 30-40-% of what you pay. 
Get it???"
University of Dayton,"Unfortunately your story doesn’t really make sense .  Unless you live on top of a mountain it takes maybe 5-10 min to get a Lyft to show up.  

The airline recommends you get to the airport like 3 hours before your flight arrives.  That’s enough time for like 20+ drivers to show up and pick you up much less for you to download Uber and try that if for some crazy reason lyft cancels on you like 10 times in a row"
University of Dayton,"If no ride takes place, you can not leave feedback.  What can you do? Suck it up and move on with your life.  Get a cab, a car service, a friend or neighbor to take you.

We are independent contractors,  and we can cancel at any time, especially on reserved rides.  You can always post your concerns here, and many drivers will laugh at you.  You can post it on crackbook... er facebook, or X/Twitter.  Again, it really doesn't matter, as no ride took place. Lyft (not lift) will not do anything other than to say, ""Sorry you weren't happy."""
University of Dayton,"Youre entirely in the wrong for wanting to leave these reviews. 

If you want a taxi or limo type service, order one. 

No Uber or Lyft driver owes you a ride under any circumstances.  Ever."
University of Dayton,I’ve  found cheap parking near the airport that turned out to be cheaper or cost as much as a as ride-share. They always have free shuttle service to and from the airport. I never use ride services when going to and from my home airport any more. I gotta imagine there’s lots near your airport you can use. Plan better next time.
University of Dayton,"The driver would have got $30 to $40 of what you paid. If the driver had to drive back empty, they would have made less than minimum wage taking your ride.

Blame Lyft. As independent contractors we don't have to take unprofitable rides, nor is there any penalty for us canceling rides."
University of Dayton,"It's cause Lyft lets every driver in your state see all the scheduled rides. And with it being a likely $35-$40 ride a driver claimed it hoping to be in the area around pickup time.  
Lyft used to let drivers see available rides only within a certain radius (like 8-10 miles) of current location, but now I can look and claim scheduled rides that are in San Francisco, while I'm in SoCal 8-10 hours away...  
It almost feels like an disgruntled outgoing app programmer made the change to put a bigger data stream onto Lyft, by allowing drivers to make much larger data requests with every refresh of the scheduled page, (which happens multiple times a minute.)"
University of Dayton,"So you want to leave a bad review because they canceled the ride and yet you have no fucking idea why they canceled???  Should I get to leave a bad review for the rider that canceled a 35.00 ride, after I had already been driving for 10 minutes???  I mean,  he's a douche nozzle right??  How dare he have something come up that he couldn't take the ride. The nerve him. 

2 hours is not enough time to get another ride?

How is this fair,  you ask?  Didn't your mom raise you that life isn't fair?  Stop your fucking whining and trying to ruin someone's job because things got a little difficult for you. Grow the fuck up!!!"
University of Dayton,Use Uber. Their reservation system is more reliable as they have more drivers available.
University of Dayton,"As a Lyft driver I don’t accept any schedule ride as pay is so bad. Lyft don’t take care of their driver and low ball them, multiple drivers need to decline your ride in order for them to raise the price a bit to attract driver and until the price is raise to a reasonable level before accepting it so it takes 10-20min."
University of Dayton,Call a cab. No driver is required to drive you for crap wages. You probably don't tip anyway
University of Dayton,"You know how unreliable these people are, you're on the same reddit I am. You hear them joke about ditching passengers and canceling rides. They're subcontractors with freedom and can do whatever they want. I wouldn't put anything mission-critical on the shoulders of someone who drives Lyft."
University of Dayton,I drive near Greenville sc. message me if you need an airport ride. We can go outside of any apps if we agree on the details
University of Dayton,"The amount of times I’ve gotten a scheduled ride, and lost it because Uber or Lyft didn’t think I was online is insane."
University of Dayton,"All this chatter about drivers making low pay is garbage!!!! As a part - time driver working 30 hrs or less a week in MN I average between $30-$50 hr. I’ve known drivers who have worked hard and paid of their Mortgage within a couple of years of driving. 
You sir, found yourself in a situation that sucks. However, you don’t know if driver A had a family emergency and had to cancel the ride or a different situation. This left the ride open for driver B, driver B may have suddenly found himself having car maintenance issues. And had to cancel. We do not receive destination info on the app when we accept rides. For me, if a $90 fare is 10 minutes away, I’m jumping at it. However as another commenter stated. I may get screwed on the return trip. So…….. tip nicely.  If I drive (? An hour and a half) to pick you up then another (?hour and a half) to your destination. That’s 3 hrs of my day on one drive and if there are no rides on the return trip, $90 is nothing. 
And yes, out of your $90 I’m possibly seeing $40."
University of Dayton,"I missed a niece's wedding because of a scenario like this one.  And had to pay an extra. $68 to re schedule plane tickets.

Lyft should be put out of business.  And Government should step in and close down a company like Lyft when they show the contempt toward consumers that Lyft exhibits."
University of Dayton,If the driver accepted the ride then cancelled then they are just assholes
University of Dayton,"I drive GSP, but Uber only, and live near Clemson. I have several semi-regulars from outlying areas where rides to the airport are nonexistent at the times they need to travel. Where are you coming from?"
University of Dayton,You can’t rate a driver who didn’t give you a ride. It’s also true they can’t rate you. It’s to protect people from revenge ratings which do happen sometimes for no reason.
University of Dayton,"There are too many customers, too many drivers and only a few options for public transport. 

This is bound to happen."
University of Dayton,Lyft and Uber do not pay their drivers enough to created any sort of continuity or reliability. Try a taxi service or pay a friend
University of Dayton,Lyft doesn’t pay any extra for scheduled rides in my market. The driver was getting probably around $20 or less for the trip. Wasn’t worth it
University of Dayton,"First off, do you know why they cancelled? No you don't, what if rhey had a flat tire to start their day? Or... theyvended up running their child to the ER, and you want to give them a bad rating?? For what?  What part of the ride that you didn't have deserves bad rating,  
Also, that $90 ride, the driver isn't even getting half of that on 90% of the time.  Next.     I've reserved rides like you pointed out, and when I log in to go get my reservation, Lyft assigns it to someone else, even though I had the reservation and was logged on on the platform with plenty of time.  

 That's like me trying to leave a Negative rating for you, for you canceling the ride when I'm sitting out front waiting!!

Your comment about Happy Customers... what about Happy Drivers.  What you DONT KNOW is what Lyft is doing to the Drivers and dropping the pay since unveiling UP FRONT PRICING!!! What you DONT KNOW, is we get screwed on pay driving you to the airport!!!!!

What needs to be done, is Lyft needs to realize how badly they are SCREWING BOTH OFVUS RIGHT NOW!! They're hurting BOTH if us right now!  And Yber is doing the same!

Reach out and ask, what is it like Driving for Lyft/Uber?  You wouldn't work your job, and work 40hrs and only get paid for 32! That's what every driver has been facing for Months now! The Medua releases you see is simply to please shareholders, Govt Officials and those who have no real clue in the truth these Drivers face. 
Can't class action them due to their Arbitrary clause.  Every single Passenger I explain this to, had no idea, NONE!"
University of Dayton,"In a small market in comparison..Dayton, OH. Can still average around 25 hr before expenses..I remember pre pandemic rideshare..driver since 2017 and been in the delivery driver arena since 95.. this time of year is always a huge hit or miss..and has been this way as long as I can remember..at least I've always seen a decent drop off at the beginning of every summer and usually picks back up after few weeks."
University of Dayton,Normally I wouldn’t pay much attention to a post like this but tonight was the first night I’ve ever had where I ended with zero rides. Couple that with no weekly challenge this week and no streak zones. I’m glad I’ve managed to keep myself activated on the delivery platforms they’re saving my ass right now.
University of Dayton,I just got offered a 700$ bonus for 60 rides.
University of Dayton,Driver lead rideshare platform. Tech company making too much.
University of Dayton,Yup I notice that. I moved to only nights now. At least I can get decent rides from airport. And work during my day time on something else.  Uber Not worth during day time.
University of Dayton,"14.13 an hour was my Month of November - Even less now. This was INCLUDING tips, cash tips and all expenses. This means with my car Id have to work about 71 hours for 1 month car payment.

&#x200B;

Good luck - Im not doing Lyft anymore either. My market has been flooded with drivers and longer wait times for me aswell. Not worth it. I did it on my free time just to do something, I stay at home now and just relax now instead.

&#x200B;

Fuck Lyft / Uber. People dont tip either. Ive explained financial shit to riders before and shows them my spreadsheets and they STILL dont tip LOL. (theyve always been the curious ones to ask the questions)

&#x200B;

You guys can have the market. When rideshare companies threaten to leave states that want to allow an actual fair wage you know theres an issue within. Multi billion dollar companies refusing to pay out."
University of Dayton,Lyft is live and well in my market
University of Dayton,I find Lyft to be as busy or moreso than Uber in Tampa lately.
University of Dayton,"Anybody else get the thing on their app that says, bonus protection.  Give 200 rides and if you don't make at least $80 in bonuses from June 1 to June 29 we will reward you with the difference? 

Really? No thanks, keep the change. Sorry as hell. I can't stand Lyft. They not only took the rental from me for a $7.00 balance in the middle of the night, but I went down there to get my personal belongings from the car, about $1000.00 worth, that P.O.S. this dude that called me up was such a sissy ass lil bit^! As soon as I asked where is my stuff he says we thew it away. You did what with my personal belongings? You better not have. He says sorry we cant do anything about it on the local level then walks off because he thought that 300 lb woman security guard was going to handle me, ha. Next week I will be raising some hell in that building until they bring me my sh%#!"
University of Dayton,It’s getting slim in Nashville rn which is weird because it’s the start of summer but this past week has been a struggle to even get 15 rides in 8-10 hours; just ridiculous.
University of Dayton,"Without a buyout, Lyft simply does not have “a few years”"
University of Dayton,Lyft is absolute crap 🗑️
Penn State,"you can pre-book rides on uber. I'd recommend doing that, some drivers prefer the long routes and less busy town streets"
Penn State,I have gotten multiple Ubers from state to altoona no problem
Penn State,"trust me, there are student who take uber/lyft all the way to JFK.

I've seen it with my friends, heard of it

cost is about $600-800, but as long as driver accepts it then its good to roll"
Penn State,"Yes, but on the weekends the upcharge is crazy because everybody is ubering to parties."
Penn State,i recommend nomad rides! it's very affordable and the owner was very nice when my friends and i met him.
Penn State,"SC is dominated by Uber, I had uninstalled Lyft for a long time"
Penn State,During busy weekends like home football games or graduation it can be expensive and delayed. Other than that Uber is a pretty good bet.
Penn State,You can schedule an Uber and get a confirmed driver beforehand.
Penn State,i had no issue getting a lyft at 4am a few years ago to the airport
Penn State,"Be there at 5, they open the checking in an hour before the flight, if you get there before you will just sit there and wait.
You can start looking for rides early, but you won't have to worry about being late.

Edit: I'm assuming SCE airport"
Penn State,I always wake up at the time I’m taking a Lyft and check if cars are around normally like a week in advance
Penn State,Just schedule and Uber or Lyft in advance
Penn State,"Honestly in my experience, I only arrive at the airport 15 minutes before the boarding starts. It is EXTREMELY small, so you will never take more than 5 minutes for check in + security. Ubers are your best bet and more than always they will be there, unless there is snow."
Penn State,Had done some Uber trips around that time recently. You should be fine considering that people are mostly back now. Shouldn’t wait more than 30 min.
Penn State,Hey were you able to get to the airport without issues? I'm running into the same problem (5:14am flight) and Nittany Express says that they don't have any drivers available at that time :/
Penn State,"I drove about 10 hours each of the past two weeks and made about $170 after taxes taken out. So usually a rate of $15-$20 per hour of driving. Then take out $60/week for gas (for me) and that drops profit down to around $100. You can drive more hours of course, which I plan on doing, but I've just had other things going on as well that keep me pretty busy. 

But you really have to drive late nights Thursday through Saturday to get constant work. The other days it's slower and sometimes you'll sit 15 minutes or longer for a ride, and you don't want to sit out of range of the hottest area because other drivers are driving around constantly and will get selected for all the rides.

Do I enjoy it? Well, it's okay. It was super stressful at first having strangers in my car and having to navigate through crowds of drunkards in the middle of the streets downtown. But I got used to it. I even started listening to podcasts while I'm driving so I can do something productive because I got tired of just music for hours, and luckily the passengers don't seem to mind and one even liked the podcast I was listening to. Ideally I would rather not drive, but if I have to in order to make money that I need, then I have to do it. "
Penn State,uber/lyft has always served me fine
Penn State,"Taxis, shuttles, and Ubers. Kinda crazy we don’t have a CATA stop there. https://www.universityparkairport.com/airport-guide/car-rentals-taxis-and-shuttles/

If you get desperate and need a ride DM me, I’m staff and work on campus."
Penn State,"I used to schedule an Uber or Lyft the night before and it always worked out for me. It was usually free, too, because the university gives a voucher to students using Lyft to get to the airport."
Penn State,"Hey! I drive weekends up at State College, and you definitely make a couple hundred a night for Thursday’s through the weekend nights. This time of year is the most lyft drivers will make because of the weather. Mostly college kids are the passengers so be ready for their drunk tendencies. Most Thursday nights I work at night till 3am and make a couple hundred and then same with Friday. Saturday you can do all day and make at least a couple hundred and then Sunday morning most likely a couple hundred as well. Hope this helps! "
Penn State,You have to get an Uber/Lyft or a taxi.  There is no bus route and hasn't been for about ten years.  If you're at a hotel or something you might be able to use their courtesy shuttle.
Penn State,"Uber/taxi, or if you have a friend with a car you can ask them for a ride."
Penn State,"Take the Red Link to the Penn Stater Hotel, then ask the bellman/woman on duty to give you a ride to the airport.  You won't be asked if you're a hotel guest.  Shuttle ride is free, so tip your driver :)"
Penn State,"First of all, congrats for getting accepted and welcome to Penn State!

Now coming to your questions, I completely understand the cultural shocks you might face but you’ll be all good! There’ll be many students like you so there won’t be that big of a difference! You’ll feel like home :) (I came from Abu Dhabi too, and am international so I can relate to these questions)

1.	Nope, people don’t care where you’re from and won’t differentiate. In fact, people are excited to meet people from different countries. 
2.	Yes, there’s a pretty big Arab community. Not one of the biggest, but there’s a lot of Arab students. I’m not sure of an Arab students association but definitely there was homecoming parade pre-covid and you’ll definitely meet fellow Arab students. 
3.	You may find drunk students off-campus on weekends but it’s never an issue. Students get used to it, and you’ll make your own group of friends who share similar interests so don’t worry. 
4.	DoorDash and GrubHub are the most used food delivery services in Penn State and they’re pretty decent services. Uber and Lyft are the driving services but they’re really expensive so people tend to avoid most of the times. The CATA bus system is pretty widespread in State College area so you’ll mostly not face any traveling issues. There’s also a lot of groceries stores, so you’ll not face any issues in that aspect too
5.	Nope racism is not tolerated at all. Rules are pretty strict and if you face any such issue, you can always report it and strict actions are taken. You’ll hear racism issues barely but whenever anything like that happens, penn state is pretty strict in those matters and takes actions regarding that.

Hope that all clears your questions, and let me know if you have any further questions. You can also dm me if you have any specific questions as well :) Have a great summer"
Penn State,"Just graduated in December so here’s my two cents.

1. Nobody cares where you’re from. The town and student body is full of people from everywhere.

2. I believe there’s a relatively decent sized arab community. And I’m willing to bet there are many clubs that you can join with other Arabs.

3. Drunk students aren’t inherently common on campus. On the weekends I’ve seen drunken brawls between morons who can’t keep to themselves. But your chances of being attacked by a drunk group of people is slim to none.

4. Food services are exceptionally well here. There’s grocery stores you can get food at. And Uber/shipt and all of those services are relatively fast and very common in SC.

5. I haven’t heard of any racist “incidents” per se. I’m sure it’s around but most people are really chill and friendly. That’s what made my experience at Penn State so awesome. You kinda just mesh into the crowd of fellow Penn Staters.

Congrats on getting accepted."
Penn State,">Hi.

Greetings!

> It's my first time living far away from home. I'm from Saudi Arabia, and I was able to secure a spot at Penn State and study Petroleum Engineering.

Congratulations and welcome to the United States!

> Obviously, you can guess the big culture shock that I'm going to face lmao.

> I have to ask, do people here really care where you come from? obviously I'm not going to scream out loud where I'm from every chance I get, but surely I'm gonna have some questions directed towards me when I meet new people.

From what I've experienced as a former employee of PSU and as a local, I'd say that for the most part, on campus it won't be a big deal and even in State College it won't be a problem.  Other students are generally pretty accepting or at least tolerant.  Locals in State College also are used to other cultures.

One thing I'd strongly recommend is the Conversation Partners Program (CPP).  It's a program designed to link international students with native English speakers who may be fellow students, faculty or staff, or even locals.  I myself have had a couple of students and it was a pleasure to meet them.  You basically meet with a person and talk to them about whatever you want, ask about cultural differences, or go out for social occasions with them.  It's pretty much up to you.  I had one young man from China and another from Saudi Arabia and it was fun speaking with them and hopefully they enjoyed my company as well.  

https://global.psu.edu/communityengageprog

> Is there a noticeable Arab community in Penn State? I would love to join any association of Arab students. Are there any mosques in State College? I don't think I'm going to pray everyday in a Mosque but I would like to pray in a Mosque on Fridays.

I'm pretty sure there is an Arabic group, and possibly a Saudi group.  You'd need to check with student affairs which would have more information.  Found one hit that might help, there may be others.

I took a quick look and found ""Saudi Arabian Student Association"" https://orgcentral.psu.edu/organization/saudi-arabian-student-association

This is the Muslim Student's Association which apparently has a Friday Prayer in the Pasquerilla Spiritual Center on Fridays from 1:30 to 2:30 pm.  
https://pennstatemsa.wixsite.com/psu-msacontact

This seems to be a non-university mosque.  I don't know how legitimate it is.  It's at 454 Rolling Ridge Drive which is a bit of a journey from campus and I personally don't know the area.
https://www.facebook.com/ISCPonline/

>Are drunk students that roam around that common? I have no experiencing of facing some random drunk guy throwing insults at me so I wanna know which areas should I avoid during the weekends lol.

Well, I don't live in State College proper, but generally the drunk idiots usually aren't out until late at night, usually on the weekends.  They pretty much just stay to themselves and unless you're trying to provoke them, they shouldn't bother you, especially if you're with friends.  Honestly, I wouldn't worry much about this unless you yourself are getting drunk in unfamiliar surroundings without any friends with you.  Basically I guess just don't be stupid?

>Also, how are the online services like food delivery apps and uber? Do you think that there is a sufficient number of grocery stores at State College?

Delivery is ok, but if you're living on campus, be advised you'll need to meet them outside or at the Commons Desk at the dorms.  They will not deliver to your dorm room since you need a keycard for those.  Uber is kind of expensive.  There are a couple of taxi companies but they aren't much better.  There are many grocery stores but if you don't have a car it kind of sucks since you have to tote those things back home.

>Lastly, and I hope no one takes this the wrong way, is racism from ignorant students common here? Have there been any big occurrences of racism that you heard of?

Like any place there will be racism but the university in general seems to be pretty tolerant and even accepting in most cases.  You will run into idiot racists but they suck and they are in the minority which I'm sure annoys them.  I'd be more concerned with your academics than what a few and unfortunately vocal people say.

>Thanks.

You're quite welcome.  Let me know if you have further questions."
Penn State,"I know of nomad rides but I don't know if they do long distances like to philly or exclusively only areas in state college: [https://groupme.com/join\_group/69490888/OV0gQSSR](https://groupme.com/join_group/69490888/OV0gQSSR) doesn't hurt to ask. That's the groupme join link. The founder is pretty active so just shoot him a DM. ""DK (Nomad Founder)"" is his user"
Penn State,"What happened to the ride-share board that was in the HUB?  I was at PSU in the early 90's and I always used it for rides back home, and I just assumed it was moved online."
Penn State,"You can always take the Megabus from the Walmart Supercenter on N. Atherton to Philly as well. Always an option if you can't find a ride but obviously the time would be set and you would probably spend less time with family and more time sitting on a bus.

Edit: Greyhound as well, they have shorter rides and later departures if you have classes."
Penn State,"I'm from the Dallas area. Most of the flights are kind of a pain. You can fly out of Pittsburgh or Philly, but the buses are so slow that most people just drive or get a ride there.

Flying out of State College is the easiest thing, but you're very limited on flights and will have to deal with a layover somewhere. Also, if you don't book your flights home at Christmas, Thanksgiving, etc., months in advance, prices are nothing short of insane. My flight home at Christmas was only manageable because I had a $450 flight credit and could fly on an off-day. If I'd gone two days earlier, it literally would have been more than $1000 to get home.

I've heard that some people fly out of Harrisburg, which is easier to get to from State College than Philly or Pittsburgh, but it still takes a lot of planning."
Penn State,"Fly directly into state college. You just gotta deal with the layovers. There’s no real way to get to pit or Philly from state college. The busses I’ve seen don’t *really* work. Or if they do, it’s a 6 hour ride."
Penn State,Curious why someone from Dallas would attend PSU? Full ride scholarship?
Penn State,"Amtrak runs daily buses from Harrisburg to State College, though he would need to get a ride from HIA to the station in downtown HBG. Just another option to consider in place of Pitt/PHI."
Penn State,"Buses to Harrisburg are probably the cheapest/easiest if you don't want to fly out of State College; it's not a bad Uber trip from the bus station in Harrisburg to the airport. I'd say Megabus to Philly is the next best option, since that bus stop is near 30th Street Station and you can take SEPTA to the airport from there. Newark's not bad either for the same reason, but you'd have to take Fullington/Greyhound buses that have additional stops and layovers and are much slower.

I know some folks here have also recommended getting a ride from State College to Tyrone to get on Amtrak but I don't believe that's much cheaper than the buses. There's also the option of making friends that live in any of those metro areas and hitching a ride with them as close as they can get to their airport."
Penn State,"My best friend, who I met at PSU freshman year, oh, 30 years ago, is from Alabama.  She came home with me to the Pittsburgh area for short breaks, like Easter, and when she flew out to see family, she caught a bus to Harrisburg to catch her flights.  Happy medium. 

The problem with the ""drive to Pittsburgh"" idea, is that drive can be a pain in the ass, or even impossible, like, say, around winter and spring breaks. I caught a bus a couple times. Yo.  Never again.  The best thing to do was catch a ride with another student with a car.  There's plenty of methods to hook up with each other there.  Either to Pittsburgh or Philly, even to Hburg. The State College airport is, hmmm, rinky dink.  But if you were going to fly from Harrisburg, it's a pretty equivalent option, time wise.  Flight availabilities are the only difference. There are little to no amenities at either airport. Rental car and a Starbucks. That's about it. 

Funny story, my best friend still lives in State College now.  I live near Harrisburg.  Her parents always flew in to see her via Philly and drove (a bit of an easier drive than from Pittsburgh), and they moved to Philly from Alabama.  Stg.  Penn State made Pennsylvanians of her whole family. 

We're actually joking via text messages right now, cuz I'm like, hey, is it spring break right now? Or this weekend?  Cuz I was gonna run up there for a visit this weekend or next, but spring break to us meant there was going to be a snowstorm to mess up everyone's travel plans.  It's just Murphy's law. 

Do with that info what you will."
Penn State,"Also from DFW, I’ve flown my mom up to visit a few times and other than around the holidays we’ve always been able to get a flight (with a layover) in/out of state college.

Around the holidays you have to plan ahead and get your flight early. This past Christmas I flew back to Dallas, but I waited until after thanksgiving to buy my tickets. There were no flights out of state college left at that point. So I found a reasonably priced (for as late as I waited to schedule it anyway) flight out of Pittsburgh on American. There were better deals out of Arnold-Palmer with Spirit or another small airliner. 

I picked the one of PIT because I thought the greyhound would get me from state college to somewhere reasonably close to the airport. However that was a totally wrong assumption. The grey hound from sc to pitt was only $30 but it was like a 6 or 8 hour ride because of all the stops. If you drive straight through it’s only like 2.5 hours. Then the Uber from the station to the airport was $60. So on the return trip I just got a rental at PIT that I could turn in at the sc airport for the same price as the Uber + greyhound and saved myself the 6 hour bus ride. 

The other thing I learned on the bus ride was that this Arnold Palmer airport I had never heard of is a stop on the same bus route to Pitt (all together that would have been the cheapest option). So I wasted a lot of time and money not planning this trip right. There’s lots of options but you’ve got have a plan apparently. 

If you were trying to avoid rentals and driving and can’t get a connection into state college the grey hound to Pittsburg isn’t a terrible option IF you go with some friends and can split the Uber to the airport. The greyhound station in state college is in walking distance of campus so you don’t need an Uber, and if you get a flight out of Arnold Palmer the bus takes you directly to the airport. So that option avoids Uber all together."
Penn State,"I’m out of state from Colorado and I personally have never chosen to fly into State College just due to the limited and expensive nature of it. I am not sure if he has in-state friends or roommates who would be willing to pick him up from the airport, but I always get a ride from Philly or Pittsburgh with one of my roommates, works out pretty well."
Temple University,"I’m assuming you live around main campus. If you can bike, you should do that. Safer than walking and way quicker and cheaper. Other than that—take the subway or Lyft/uber shared rides (the safest choice)which shouldn’t be more than 2-5 bucks each way 

Idk if temple offers anything "
Temple University,"I've used many rental programs the best is from rideshare rental .
You have to really drive 7 days a week 12plus hours to make it worth it"
Temple University,"They wont tell you this, but on top of the ride requirement per week and the $1000.00+ a month just on the rental cost alone, no gas included, renters only get paid half the rate a driver does that uses their own vehicle."
Temple University,"Renting through a rideshare company is a horrible deal. In my market, it would take 2-2.5 *days* of working to pay the weekly rental fees."
Temple University,"You can get it, pay the 400 a week, get the zero deductible, get the personal miles, and drive 20 trips while, for 4 days, to and from, working for an Amazon job paying 18 or more dollars....while working some other gig app that pays better and get in 20 rides before the end of the week.

They require you pay down the cost of the rental before you actually earn any income...which is stupid because you have no gas money, cleaning, or food money until you pay off the car.. hints you add in personal miles, however many you'll need, and use those to get paid since you are new and bounes aren't a thing until you do a certain number of trips.

Well, at least that is what it was for me ..no bonuses showed until I was over 100 trips and had a great score with customers..which is also stupid because they lie a lot to get you kicked from the platform as they be something of stupidity that need a Lyft or Uber to get to work yet screw drivers that are willing to give them the rides..having cameras matter and living in a one party consent to recording state matters.

End of week is how long you have to get those 20 rides..which start on Monday and ends on Monday of the following week.

Come September 11th, is a date they say rental changes are coming, as in cost not an end... I suppose. Figure they are either raising the price, 400 dollars a week is outrageous already, or giving out incentives for rental drivers. I would not bet on the second one... because that would make too much of a benefit to us drivers who make them money as they don't have to rely on customer's tips as we do because they take 80 to 90 percent of the money charged to customers.

I am having a ragging clue its a screwing coming real soon and 9/11 is the date they chose....America get screwed again in the gig economy...I literally can't afford to work lyft full time with the stupid cost before income is earned.. not sure why they would not just take 40 or half earnings each day while you widdle down the cost of the rental... also gave out more funds to renters.. the major issues you have to consider are if you are young, in shape, and willingness to work 5 or more painful jobs just to survive or can you be OF girl that earn 30k per month doing the laziest job in the world getting paid like a lot of art BS jobs that don't really contribute to society..such as Athletes, artists, designer clothing brand maker, idiot influencer on social media, politicians and the list goes on....LOL"
Temple University,Yes you make less make cus the cars gonna run you 1000$ a month at cheapest plan but also the rate card is lower so you’ll also get paid less per ride compared to other Lyft drivers
Temple University,"Im trying this out and will report back, need some sort of second job before I lock in a second restaurant job. 

But just some simple math here

Either way, there are way better ways to make money in this world. This is only something that should be done in emergencies (which I am in at the moment), and Lyft knows that hence the horrid pay.  Then, 600x.80 = $480 to account for taxes (Need to set aside 20% to be smart.  That means if I work about 30 hours/week Ill net $150/week. Thats $600/month I didn't have in my pocket before. Then divide 600 by total hours per month and you get 5. So to rent a vehicle from Lyft, you make about $5/hour after taxes and fees. If you want to do all those same calculations with a car you're making payments on its probably a little bit better but harder to factor in cost of maintenance and more upfront costs. And if you own the car and want to run it into the ground, I guess this is the best scenario but just know you pay for everything either now or later, that's the way the world works.

Either way there are way better ways to make money in this world. This is only something that should be done in emergencies (which I am in at the moment), and Lyft knows that hence the horrid pay."
Temple University,"Don't believe these people on here. I have been renting with lyft for 7 months. I make between $1700 and $2100 a week. My rental costs $251 a week. It is deducted from my account on Mondays starting at 5am. So the first $251 I make goes to lyft. But I leave the app online and also do Empower, or uber. So I'm still able to cash out something on Mondays. I have a Honda Insight 2021. Get 60 MPG costs $20 to fill up every 2 days. Drive about 400 miles a day. Put over 35000 miles on this car in 7 months. Do you really want to do that to your personal car????? I pay about $1000 a month. It covers rental, insurance, all oil changes, pm, all repairs are done at my house or the Hub. Free of charge with a free loaner. I add $30 per week and have zero deductible for accidents. I can run this car I to the ground. And when it bottoms out. I just swap it out for another one."
Temple University,"I didn’t bring it first semester and then had it for the last 3.5 years. Never paid for parking. Once you learn the parking patterns and where spots are it’s fairly easy. If it’s a newer car I’d probably leave it home, but I had an older car that I didn’t car if it got bumped or scratched. Was able to do Uber and Lyft to pay my rent too. Being able to drive to good grocery stores and run out to grab things easily instead of having them shipped and stolen off our porch off campus was great."
Temple University,If you live on campus or real close to campus you definitely don't need know car everything you need is literally in walking distance or a short bus ride.if you do get a car you definitely gotta worry about car break ins and parking
Temple University,"If you’re commenting to campus sure but if you’re on campus I don’t really see the point. Amtrak takes you pretty far and there’s also greyhound busses for spots that amtrak doesn’t hit. Regional rail, subway, busses and uber are also an option for areas near/ just outside of the city. I’d say skip it freshman year and if you find yourself really needing it bring it next year"
Temple University,">Can one earn enough driving solely for Lyft in, say, 30 hours to cover the rental+expenses should rental rewards not be achieved? 

Maybe, but do you want to drive 30 hours just to pay for the rental?

Rental is only useful if you drive enough to cover the cost, which is unlikely with the hours and days you have available.



"
Temple University,"I work in Philly with Uber and Lyft. I really don't think renting a car is a good idea, yeah at the end of the day you are using and print milage on your car but really what are cars for then? I can make 1200 a week easily if I work about 40 hours. If you want to work part time make sure you don't work set hours work when it is busy you will make more that way. I know sometimes you can't do that but it's a waste of time working dead hours. In my opinion dead days are Tuesday and Wednesday. But then again sometimes it picks up on those days so I go drive, I try to take off on those days. Work hard and smart you will make good money. You can make lots of money on the weekends. I start my Fridays at 2pm to 3am or if not busy 12am ... If looks really busy 4am. Saturday 4pm to 4am goal if dead go home at 12am. You really have to make your schedule after you know the market. I have been driving since August at first part time and now full time. I will be going part time again soon. My good days are Fridays to Sunday my goal is to pull in about 600-800 in these three days. The rest of the days I do it just cuz I am trying to hit the bonus."
Temple University,"shryft is the essentially the same process as fryft, only now being that the rides you book will most likely be shared w another person- usc student or not. fryft was nice bc you could have a whole car to yourself, and basically 2-3 of your friends could ride along. now you can only have 1 other person. i was a first year fall 2021 and had only known fryft, but it was changed (back) to shryft spring 2023 (most likely bc covid policies were starting to loosen up, and fryft probably costs usc a ton more money). shryft was horrible in the beginning though, bc waiting for one could literally take hours, compared to minutes w fryft. i definitely think the system is better now though, since i haven’t had to wait nearly as long towards the end of the semester. once you book a ride, you’re automatically either put in a car w 1-2 others, or you may have the car to yourself, or pick up another person. it works 7 days a week 6pm-2am, but home fb games and other coliseum events affect that. hope this helps!"
Temple University,"People are being dramatic. I’ve never once been in a shryft with a non-usc student, and although sometimes they can take a while and being inconvenient, they are SO SO SO SO MUCH SAFER than walking alone through south central at night. Saves you a ton of money too."
Temple University,Shryft is much less safe and anxiety-free bc ur with a random person and possibly not sober. It also takes years to get a ride and lies about how soon it'll be
Temple University,I got the email invitation for this rideshare. But I’m still confused. Do we have to live on campus or what is the mile radius we can be from campus and still be order a ride?
Temple University,I stopped using the program once they switched over to shryft
Temple University,"It’s serious, be surprise how many drivers will accept the ride.
Why do you think every year they cut the pay?"
Temple University,I’ve been wondering about upfront pay and tolls on Lyft. With Uber the upfront pay offer they give doesn’t include tolls but they still pay you for it so you know their offer is actually what you’ll net after tolls. Now my question is does Lyft do the same thing ? I’ve taken a couple of trips that I wondered about toll payment and couldn’t remember the offer for the life of me to compare it with the earnings after the fact.
Temple University,Get rides to NJ from Philly all the time. That’s weird it’s only $12? Usually there atleast $18-22 for me going over the bridge
Temple University,"Tolls are **NOT** included in that Up Front ""earnings"".

After you do a trip including a toll open the Ride Summary for it and you'll see that the Tolls are all passthru to you, on top of the ""earnings"" you were quoted Up Front.

Just make sure to keep track of the Tolls for tax purposes, as it'll look like income if you don't deduct the expense of the tolls."
Temple University,"Of course they are serious. We see that from the Jersey side constantly taking people to Philly. Then you guys get all the surging when the event is over and people need to come back. In addition, you can pick up rides on the way back. Jersey drivers can't.

Sounded harsh. Not at you, but it is definately a struggle from this side."
Temple University,"I live in Philadelphia, I drive in Pennsylvania. I’m just trying to straight up OPT OUT of rides that terminate in New Jersey! What paperwork do I have to submit? I don’t feel like doing it - maybe I will, but I’m definitely going to sign up for Uber first thing tomorrow morning. This app is telling me I can’t take a ride after I drop someone off in New Jersey! so much red tape… it wasn’t like this…."
Temple University,I also have the $20 Lyft Pass transaction 1 day after the my Lyft ride where I used the promotional pass. Really hope it doesn't show up on my statement.
Temple University,"Schedule the ride, there are likely drivers in your area that only look for those."
Temple University,"Remember minus the tip, what you pay for the ride isn't what the driver get.  You may pay $150 for a ride.  Driver will get at most $60-80."
Temple University,"I have taken many rides like that. Don’t worry about the driver. We chose to do this for a living. 
We have the ability to do destination type of rides. Meaning that we input and address to where we want to go and the system will find rides going I. The direction. 
I have taken a passenger 3 1/2 hours away. That was close to 200 miles."
Temple University,"As a fairly new driver, I didn't understand why so many riders complained about cancelation. Now that Lyft has dropped our rates to match Uber, it makes sense. The best way to get  a driver not to cancel is put where you are going and that you will tip up front. Depending on the phone and drivers level (silver, gold ,etc.), they may bot see the full trip info. They may be in a ride and Lyft adds it to the queue automatically and the driver doesn't get a chance to accept or reject. We don't want to cancel which is why we are out here driving. Sometimes riders do not know the B.S. ride share apps put us through."
Temple University,Do Lux for a guaranteed rides
Temple University,"I did a 250 mile ride twice in one week.  But nothing tipped $100 each. Some huge tennis tournament came here and they were on the team. You get kids but they had their coach with them. Or parent. It was an adult. 
If no tip, so not worth it."
Temple University,Be open to drivers being wtf but maybe tell them what Lyft is charging you and say you will pay that directly without Lyft to butter them up
Temple University,"You could call your driver when they accept and ask them to do the trip off the app? Offer them whatever you were going to pay Lyft. The driver makes more and you save on the tip. I drive for Lyft/Uber and prefer to do business this way on long trips. In fact, it's usually the only way I'll drive further than a half hour."
Temple University,I am a lyft driver and my status of gold allows me to see the distance and what direction my passenger is going before I accept. I have done a 75 mile trip. I like the longer trips cause it's more money.
UNLV,"Even I hate Lyft too much, ( and even that price surge wont affect the driver ), this is probably the algorithm. Lyft fired lots of people bec of their greed, no one is sitting in front of a computer and surging prices through any event, i am sure. Too many ride requests"
UNLV,"It's been a while since I attended UNLV or lived in Las Vegas so this is more general advice but should still be helpful. 

Call 211. The operator will interview you about your situation, demographics, etc. and then give you a detailed list of programs and charities that can help you with your specific situation. Please note that they are a referral service so you will have to make additional calls and file additional forms to actually get help, but 211 will save you a ton of time in figuring out what help is available and there's a lot of programs out there that you may have never found on your own. 

While your current need is paying your rent, if you can cut all your other expenses then that leaves more money left over to pay your rent. So be sure to ask 211 about assistance with utilities, phone, internet, food, discounted bus passes, etc. and not just rental assistance. Anything you currently have to spend money on, ask if there's a program to help pay for it. For example, you can most likely get free phone service and heavily discounted internet service and you might not even have to switch providers. 

Not paying for groceries can be a HUGE money saver to leave you more money towards paying rent. Apply for food stamps (caveat: you may be disqualified as a student, but try anyway, the rules keep changing) and also start going to every food bank you can.  

Go to the food banks first and get as much free food as possible before going to the grocery store, then use your limited food stamps and/or grocery budget to only buy the missing ingredients necessary to turn the free food into meals. 

If you need other things like toilet paper, pet food, etc. then ask about that when you check in at the food bank because a lot of food banks have limited supplies of that available upon request but don't put it out on the main floor. If you have any dietary restrictions or don't have access to a full kitchen then be sure to tell them when you check in because they often have special foods set aside for people who need them.

If getting to the food banks is a problem because of distance or scheduling, contact them and ask them if they offer home delivery. Lyft has partnered with a bunch of food banks to provide free home delivery for people who are unable to go in person during the hours the food bank is open. You don't get as much choice in what you get since someone else is picking out the food for you but it's better than nothing. 

Before buying anything, ask for it on your local Freecycle and Buy Nothing groups. They're usually Facebook Groups but some places still do email lists. You can even ask for food there. A lot of people have stuff in their pantry that they realize they're not going to eat because they've lost their taste for it or started a new diet or whatever and they'll be happy to box it up and give it to you. Even if you have dietary restrictions or need something super specific, you never know -- I recently gave away a bunch of expensive fancy frozen vegan meals to a vegan because my husband had stocked up on the wrong flavor. 

Google ""Las Vegas"" plus ""mutual aid"" and/or ""free store"" to find informal resources that 211 might not have in their database. Lots of anarchocommunists and kindred spirits run regular weekly or monthly pop-ups in parks where they give away personal hygiene items, winter clothing, etc. to people who are homeless or otherwise living in poverty. ""Food Not Bombs"" is another good org, if they have a local chapter. 

Sikh gurdwaras usually offer a free meal at least once a week (sometimes daily) called langar and if you go to it then while you are there you can ask them if they are able to help you with anything else -- it's one of their religious commandments to help anyone who asks them for help and most Sikhs are delighted to be given an opportunity to fulfill that commandment to the point where they act like you did them a favor by asking. In my experience, the help they offer tends to be very personalized and more like one-on-one mutual aid than a formal charity program you apply for. It's a very tight-knit community so if you need a job then they can probably find you a job at a Sikh-owned company, if you need a working car then they can probably find you a Sikh mechanic who will fix your car for free/cheap, if you need a place to live then they can probably find you a Sikh landlord who will let you make reasonable weekly payments instead of needing to pay first/last/deposit up front, etc. I used to work for a Sikh and he was always hooking people up with stuff, including randos he'd literally just met (I was his bookkeeper so I got the backstories behind all his odd charges). 

If there is anyone who usually gives you a Christmas present, e.g., your parents, grandparents, etc. then be honest with them about your financial situation and ask them if they could please give you cash for rent instead of a gift this year. If they might not trust you with cash for whatever reason, you could ask them to write a check directly to your landlord / property manager or give them your rent payment portal login.

If someone ends up giving you a non-cash present anyway, scan the barcode and look it up on Google Shopping to figure out where it's sold, and if it's sold at Walmart, Target, etc. then you should be able to return it for store credit even if you don't have the receipt and then spend that credit on necessities like groceries, toilet paper, etc.

It's been a long time since I attended UNLV so I don't know what their current resources are but it's definitely worth making an appointment with the financial aid office to tell them you are in a financial crisis and see if there are any emergency funds or additional loans that you qualify for. Many schools have one-time emergency grants for students, or are willing to advance a portion of the next term's financial aid, but don't always advertise it so you have to ask to find out if it's even available. And while private student loans like Sallie Mae are generally not a good idea, taking one is less bad than becoming homeless.

If you've exhausted all of the above and are still going to be short on rent, talk to your landlord or property manager about it as soon as possible and work out a realistic payment plan. For example, if you won't be able to pay full rent on January 1st but will be able to pay as soon as your financial aid disburses later in the month, offer to pay them as much as you can on the 1st and then pay the rest by the end of the month.

A budgeting strategy that my husband and I have found helpful is to prepay our rent for the entire term as soon as he receives his law school financial aid disbursement so that we won't need to pay rent again before the next disbursement, then we use my income to pay for our other expenses. So we use August's disbursement to pay 5 months rent, January's disbursement to pay 4 months rent, and May's disbursement (he takes summer classes) to pay 3 months rent. Then we know our housing is secure even if I lose my job or we have some other financial emergency, and we don't have a large sum of money sitting around in our bank account tempting us to fritter it away on stupid shit. You might want to try that if you tend to run out of money at the end of the term.

Hope that helps! Good luck!"
UNLV,"I drive in Las Vegas. All you need to do is apply on the app. No way to apply in person. When you do apply on the app, use my referral code so you and I get extra bonus when you complete a certain amount if rides. 

Hey! Drive with Lyft in Las Vegas, and you get a bonus up to $760 if you give 210 rides in your first 30 days. Terms apply. https://www.lyft.com/drivers/LEE58038

I also recommend applying for Uber as well.

And if you use my referral code, I’ll be happy to teach you the tricks of the trade. DM me when you apply so I’ll know it’s you."
UNLV,We have WAY too many drivers out here. You not going to make money on Lyft out here.
UNLV,"Vegas Uber driver here. It’s kept me afloat during times I was between steady jobs. If you can master not only WHERE but WHEN to drive, it can be decent. Even more so if you’re like me and your car is fully paid off"
UNLV,I do gig work. I’ve never done rideshare so can’t answer about Lyft but  you can make decent money doing Ubereats during lunch and dinner and you can make good money doing spark if you multi app both of them you can make 30 an hour
UNLV,As a driver for both platforms. Lyft pay is crap.  You’ll make more money with Uber.
UNLV,"Uber > Lyft

Make sure you get a sign up referral/bonus when signing up"
UNLV,Uber is a well established name in the industry. People flock to it just because others do. Lyft does have it’s fair share in the industry but when “most” people want a ride.. the instinctively choose Uber just due to conditioning. Go with Uber. You will make more.
UNLV,I’ve never driven but I saw someone in /r/uberdrivers describe Uber in Las Vegas as a “cheat code.”
UNLV,Uber is good
UNLV,"Yes, I know a couple lyft/uber drivers, most use both platforms. One driver makes just $760- $1,000, working just 3 days a week and not on the strip. Another makes over $2,000 in 5 days just doing airport rides, but she'sprobably driving for 10 hours. Of course there's insurance expense, fuel, cost of renting a car $239 a week through lyft or uber relationship with Hertz. Both Lyft & Uber want drivers to have newer vehicles so many drivers have to rent."
UNLV,Yes it’s totally worth it. Log on and drive. - Lyft
UNLV,"Fuck no. He can cry all he wants. That sounds like a Lyft to the bus station or airport. 

But, some dumbass will take it. Actually since this post is an hour old, assuming this happened right before you posted this, some dumbass is probably doing it right now. Is approximately 4 more hours we will see a post titled “what the fuck Lyft is bullshit” posting a screenshot of only getting paid 198$ to make the trip, and in the comments something like “Lyft is a bunch of thieves. I drove this raving lunatic from LV to LA, 198$ with no tip! I’m now stuck in California because I can’t afford gas to get home because Instant pay out doesn’t work and it’s going to cost me another 75$ in gas to get home!” Someone help me!"
UNLV,Unless there were five $100 bills in his hand ready to give to me (in addition to what Lyft paid) heeeeeeellllll no I would not take that ride.
UNLV,That’s ridiculous. I would have referred them to the Greyhound station. There’s no way you could realistically expect someone ordering a Lyft back to Vegas from LA so you’d be stuck! I wonder too how much that ride was for passenger and how much you would have been paid
UNLV,Possibly as an effort to help someone out. Certainly not for the money - you would LOSE money on that ride.
UNLV,If you want need to get to Los angels do it but if not not worth it ! Unless you are Lux driver getting paid Lux per mile
UNLV,"Iv taken this ride. A black came in from SD, guy had a business meeting in Vegas no flights would make his time. If he left right then he'd make it.

I took him off uber for 2 reasons 1) I have tcp and ins. 2) I'd make like 1000 to 1200 for 4.5 hours one way. Not enough.

He and I agreed on full black rate which I think back then was 1600. It's a little less now, did round trip in 1 day took 14 hours total including traffic. $150ish in gas (might been less but I don't remember it's been too long)"
UNLV,How much you usually make in a day? Ask for that in cash on top of the ride maybe. Though he may report you
UNLV,"The drive won't go beyond state line. I got a request to the edge of Nevada last year and when I arrived to p/u passenger, the group of 4 people said their car broke down and they needed to get to Riverside before work tomorrow. I took the ride to state line (XL ride, ~$90) and then charged them $400 cash to Riverside. I was already pretty tired from driving all day and that was a bitch getting back. I was soooooo tired. Thankfully an old friend called me on Facebook and kept me awake and from passing out behind the wheel. I probably shouldn't've taken it, but they seemed desperate so I did them a solid."
UNLV,Did he call it or did the hospital? If it was the hospital there’s no way in hell anyone would do it . It doesn’t pay shit and the chance of a tip are 0% . But if the guy called it I would negotiate and do it for whatever Lyft quoted them
UNLV,Never accept rides from hospitals
UNLV,I dont want to ride 5 mins with someone that just had their stomach pumped.
UNLV,"If its a third party paying for it, like the hospital, just don't say you dropped them off and drive back on their dime. It's highly unethical but when it comes to rides like that I find my ethics relax a bit more. Of course if lyft finds out they'll prob deactivate you."
UNLV,"No. This is not possible  to do 175 rides in 3 days. Lyft knows this. 

Lyft should be criminally liable when a drivers hurts somone trying to make this challenge."
UNLV,"58 rides per day (assuming three days), haha, no way"
UNLV,"Even working the maximum 12 hours a day you'll have a hard time.

I did 160 rides memorial day weekend in San Diego between uber and lyft, 16 hours Friday, 15 hours Sat and 12 hours Sunday, and that was non stop short rides.

If you can get 4 rides an hour (not likely) it'll take you 37.5 hours to hit your goal but unlike memorial day it will slow down early on Sunday"
UNLV,I don’t know about anyone else but when I accept challenges my rides seem to be throttled
UNLV,Hell no. That’s way too much for 3 days. And I’ve done around 36 minimum fare rides a day and that burned me out. But more than that the demand has to be constant
UNLV,They keep getting closer to 200. I think this is going to be one of Lyft's upcoming legal problems. Someone in a jam is going to die trying to finish one of these.
UNLV,"Sorry, but no, that's impossible unless the total trip is maybe a five minute drive for each and every ride, but with traffic and passengers getting in and out, forget it. Lyft just likes to give everyone the middle finger."
UNLV,It’s hard for me to do 50 rides over weekend lol
UNLV,the only way this can work is lyft/uber count multiple stops from a customer as its own seperate trip ..so if a customer wants to stop at a store along the way it shud be counted as another not as a extension to tbe current 1 so it can be counted towards this challenges
UNLV,"Let's say you averaged the same fare for each of the 175 rides.

At the minimum, you would have made $4.80/ride. Most likely with the average, they would all be 2-5 mile rides.

You would have had to arrive to, pick up, and drop off, and switch 175 different rider(s).

You don't get paid when you are on the way to a rider, or after you drop them off and are in between the last rider to the next rider.

So if you spend 5 minutes for 175 riders, you are wasting 875 minutes.

&#x200B;

Now let's say you took 20 different 30-40 mile rides and got paid $40 for each one. You would have made $800. You would have only had in-transit minutes multiplied by 20 different people. If it takes 5 minutes to reach 20 people, you only spend 100 minutes not getting paid.

You would be paid more for time in the car with a passenger. Less clean up, less vacuuming, less car washes and less gas. Less stops. And you still get paid $800.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind. If you do 175 rides, and you make over $840, they won't pay you the $840. If you do 175 rides and make $700, they will only give you $140.

&#x200B;

Go take a math class. Don't chase promotions."
UNLV,"Whao!! 
Mine is max 40 rides fir $230.00"
UNLV,Very cynical of lyft.
UNLV,No freaking way! 😂. 95 rides is tough
UNLV,I’m in OC also. For one I don’t have it in me for that many rides. Secondly I’m never getting that many pings to hit that. I have to use both apps to have any luck.
UNLV,Sunday i made 27 rides and took 10 hours
UNLV,"No way that is possible, I only select 65 rides or less since I work only 2 days Friday and Saturday but to add Sunday into the play maybe 95 which is your lowest tie."
UNLV,Bullshit!  Impossible to do.  Think about that math. That is about 60 rides you have to do every day this weekend to hit that kind of a number. With all macro factors in play that makes it literally impossible to hit a number like that.
UNLV,Unlikely to do more than 5 rides per hour in the 36 hours you’d be able to drive. Even doing 95 total rides is challenging.
UNLV,No. This is basically criminal on Lyfts part.
UNLV,"I'm in arbitration now for lyft stealing and committing fraud. 

Misrepresentation. 

I rented a vehicle and have a contract that states they have to detail everything you are paying for. They cut my rate per mile from 60 cents per mile in Las Vegas, to TWENTY THREE (23) CENTS PER MILE. And they did it without notice, after I had rented the vehicle and was obligated to give a certain number of rides at that rate.

Right after I filed, 3 lyft software engineers and 3 former software engineers jump on my linked in ooking for personal connections. 

Not only do I have a W here on contract breach, but arbitration does not have jurisdiction over the PRIVACY INVASION by their current and former software engineers stalking me.

So I'll see them in federal court. Every single one.

You don't have to be abused by this company.
STAND UP"
UNLV,"Simple math. That's 58 rides a day, if you drive for 12 hours straight you have to do almost 5 rides per hour, that means that no ride can take more than 12 minutes from pickup spot to drop off location. It's not feasible at all. I wouldn't be able to reach this amount of trips where I live, and that's one of the biggest cities in the world."
UNLV,20 rides a day for 3 days for $480 😮‍💨 that part
UNLV,175 rides in a single weekend is impossible. i did 100 rides in a weekend for a bonus and it literally almost killed me
UNLV,58 ride a day is impossible
UNLV,"You guys really let these companies pimp you out. Damn the challenges, surges, etc. Make a reasonable and solid schedule. Be consistent. If you happen to be out during a challenge and hit marks, that’s a plus. If you’re in an area and a surge hits, that’s a plus. 

Work for your money. Don’t chase the work. 

What they’re trying to do is make you work “harder” with promises of more money with challenges but these challenges are damn near impossible and the incentive is a one time thing. There’s no consistent raises (as far as I know).

Realistically they should be adding an automatic bonus either annually or based on performance to drivers and give you guys actual raises. Like a guaranteed $5-8 on top of what you’d make from any ride. Their incentives are bogus. Other work places give actual raises and promotions for hard work. Lyft is getting you guys with that carrot in front of the rabbit routine. 

They’re basically pimping you. All of that stress, growling stomach and straining bladder isn’t worth it."
UNLV,"Just request rides on burner account and accept them yourself as a driver, half a mile distance each. Profit."
UNLV,"I wouldn’t take the gamble. If you fall short, then you will have to rely on fares from all of those three dollar rides you took to get the bonus."
UNLV,I’ll probably just do the middle one. 115 rides
UNLV,Been driving for Uber for 4 years now. They just offered me $900 guaranteed to give 90 rides and gave me 30 days to do it in.   Easiest money I’ve ever made.
UNLV,"If this was a weekday challenge I'd say go camp the USC campus with a 5 mile radius filter on. I finished a 60 ride challenge in 3, 4 hour weekdays after my day job."
UNLV,You gotta take every ride no excuses. There’s 24 hours in a day it can be done.
UNLV,"Not in my market, no. I'd be lucky to get 50 Lyft rides if I was online for 50+ hours."
UNLV,"If u can do 60 rides it’s still worth choosing the $840 challenge, at least 20 rides a day depending on where u live shouldn’t be to hard and $480 is worth more than the other option combined."
UNLV,"I did 2 x 12 hr shifts on Uber and only managed about 40 rides per shift in busy areas with short rides and close pickups. 

With Lyft I doubt it is possible... You would maybe get somewhat close if you drove 12, break for 6... repeat... but then again even if you drove 36 hours... that's ridiculous. You might be able to hit 115. good luck :/ I would select the 2nd option if I were you. In all honesty... the last option might be the only possible one."
UNLV,This is how people take the $2 rides
UNLV,Lol that’s 58 rides a day. That’s roughly 5 rides an hour for 12 hours straight. Naw bro. I don’t do Lyft but I can do math and this isn’t realistic.
UNLV,"That is insanity … I am taking the challenge of a 60 ride weekend, which will be insane (I have a day job) so my weekend most likely won’t start until after 5:00 pm on Friday"
UNLV,"If you can do a minimum of 25 rides a day in your Market sure, would never make it in my market. For a few months I did this full time 60 to 65 hours a week and the most rides I ever got was 81 in one week"
UNLV,They know 175 is impossible. Maybe you’ll hit 115 but the last 60 is you just taking their shitty rides to achieve a goal they know you’ll never make which is just more opportunity to steal money from you/passengers
UNLV,"Unless you know someone that has no life that can book x-amount of extremely short rides with you while siphoning the money back & forth, you can go ahead and scrap that"
UNLV,"It’s doable if Lyft doesn’t play games.  I’ve done 185 rides in 3 days.  As long as you can constantly
Pick up customers and go beyond the 12 hour driving limit you’ll definitely get it done.  Lyft may play games 3/4 way through of the quest just to not pay you out lmao"
UNLV,I wouldn’t do it because you will feel depressed when you are 5-10 rides away and don’t make it
UNLV,"Wtf why am I getting these shitty 60 ride $110 challenges? What market are you in? 
I’m in south Florida I did 40 rides in 11.5 hours last Sunday. Took one 30 min ride by mistake. All others I only accepted 15 mins or less"
UNLV,"Yes but its going to be **incredibly** difficult. Lyft may even make it nearly impossible. The best thing to do IMO is go with the 95 ride challenge. Lyft is going to throw you a ton of shit rides (long distance, small pay) and throttle your account the closer you get to the goal."
UNLV,It’s probably doable if you hang around Disneyland area. Short trips to hotels is easy picking. Used get about 10-20 rides there at the end of the night with everyone leaving.
UNLV,"It’s could be possible if you live near a college that is in session and have share ride. At USC they have share ride and this challenges are really easy to accomplish when you are picking up 3 passengers at a time and driving them within a mile from the campus. BUT, they are not in session and unfortunately it is not possible to complete the whole challenge without share ride. But I wish you luck 🍀 

Sincerely, 

That Guy on Reddit"
UNLV,Hell no its not.... uber ceo just wants us to think it is
UNLV,No I work Uber in OC . 30ish a day is pretty much the max.
UNLV,"175 rides?

It isn't possible to do 70 in that time frame.

Obviously not."
UNLV,Can you not just do the first tier of 60 rides or is it all or nothing?
UNLV,"The $205 is dumb:

If you target 20 rides then you are better off going for the $360 and earn $105 instead of $50. 

If you target 95 rides then you are better off going for the $840 and earn $480 across 60 rides rather than $205 across 95. 


OP, your options are to either play the $360 game and earn $105 on 20 rides, or play $840 and give a minimum of 60 rides for $480."
UNLV,And I thought my 110 ride offer was unreasonable.
UNLV,The most rides I’ve done in a day was 38 so by that metric it is technically possible however very unlikely becuz that would be extremely difficult to pull off.
UNLV,I mean if ur in a downtown area with a radius filter taking all the small rides if busy enough u can get the 60 done in a day maxing out ur time. Even then the calculations might show that’s not worth it or the stress of PAX in and out
UNLV,"This is twisted. 

Giving an unobtainable goal so their company can complete more rides at the expense of their employees. 

Companies stay treating us like numbers on a spreadsheet and less like human beings each year."
UNLV,Their goal is to get more drivers to TRY. They have historical data that show what % will succeed.
UNLV,Lyft is shit this is exactly why I use Uber
UNLV,"At an average ride time of 15 minutes, 175 rides would take 43.75 hours or 1.82 days. If the max time you can work is 12 hours a day, you would be short by 7.75 hours.

The max average complete ride time to achieve this would be 12.3 minutes. That doesn’t even include breaks and waiting for the next ride. This “challenge” seems literally impossible. Maybe you could get away with it in an area that is swamped for 12 hours each day and the rides are only a minute or two."
UNLV,I’m inn the LA area too . Mine for this weekend is $200 for 55 rides plus my $150 for 50 EV bonus. 60 rides is the most ill try . 20 a day its easy of i have the time anything more than that its pure torture. Hang out around westwood near UCLA it gets busy with short trips from college kids .
UNLV,if you where to sleep 8 hours a night and as soon as you wake up go dash for 16 hours for those 3 days you’d have to average 4 rides an hour
UNLV,Is it just completed rides? How often do people register for these? Happy to ask my driver to drop me off the block to add to the complete count
UNLV,"I can do that in my market, but not in the summer. I've had 196 rides in a week before. 

Lots of minimum rides. On a busy night, I'll do 4-5 rides an hour.

Edit: I just saw it's only through Thursday. Nevermind."
UNLV,It’s impossible. Even with non stop back to back $4 rides
UNLV,"Even if you set up a perimeter filter to a 5 mile radius you can do about 3 rides per hour,
Meaning that you would have to do about 58-60 hours, but the app shuts you down at 12 hrs per day…
So its NOT possible."
UNLV,"Imagine destroying your own personal property, not including gas and maintenance costs, the liability of being on the roads which are considerably the most dangerous places a human can be, and dealing with the fucktards that are lyft riders. For next to nothing."
UNLV,No guarantee that they will even send you 175 rides to accept during that period…
UNLV,"If each ride takes 30 mins on average (even short rides can take 30 mins by the time someone finally gets in the car and driving to the next rider) that’s 48 rides per day if you are not sleeping. Multiply that times 3.

These people are sick."
UNLV,"I couldn't even make a challenge that was similar to the lowest challenge on this list. 95 rides for $200 in a 4 (really 3 because the 5 am monday deadline is bullshit) day weekend challenge. 

First day I couldn't even break 15 rides with how slow it was. Similar situation the next day. At that point I gave up, because it already takes me a full 9 hrs AT LEAST on a GOOD day to make it past 20 rides, and then there are days where I'm online for the full 12 hours and can't even break past 20. I'll be damned trying to fit 30+ rides in a day. 

So it's quite literally impossible. And it's really scummy that lyft baites us with these big bonuses that you kill yourself trying to achieve, but they also force you to lock it in early before you can get a feel for how the market will be once it starts, so if you pick the highest tier and can't make it because on one of the days lyft only gave you 5 rides, you won't get any bonuses, even if you technically beat the requirements of a lower tiered package that you didn't pick in advance."
UNLV,You’re talking 60 rides for 3 days… seek help lmaooo
UNLV,You would need like 5 rides an hour running 3 12 hour days.
UNLV,"Lol 175 rides in less than 3 days ( you will need to rest in between). Lyft is smoking some weed I don’t know about. Man , your car would thank you for not doing this stupid ride challenge.

You know what you are going to get? Traffic tickets and insane car issues."
UNLV,"Assuming you do 3 rides an hour, you would have to do 19.5hrs a day to complete this challenge. Doable but damn near impossible."
UNLV,"No way this is 58 rides a day let's assume a ride from start to accepting the next is 30 mins

That's accept pick up drive  drop off 30 mins
Ok so 58 rides at half hr each   29 hrs a day
So we gotta find shorter rides
20 mins? 19.3 hrs a day not safe  ok 
10 mins? 9.33 hrs a day sounds cool but doubt you find 175 10 minute rides"
UNLV,My top tier challenger for this weekend on Lyft was $320 for 90 rides. I'm usually lucky to do 60 rides in 20-24 hours on Friday and Saturday.
UNLV,If the average ride is 30 minutes and you are getting nonstop rides with no downtime. It would take you 90 hours. Even doing it for 3 days straight with no downtime you wouldn’t be able to achieve it
UNLV,"3 rides an hour for 72 hours straight, with 4 hours of sleep, not including breaks and refueling is one breakdown….

How many do you get in an hour during non peak times? Could you operate a motor vehicle with minimal sleep? Can you control it so they’re all super short rides in a downtown area?

I know nothing about being a rideshare driver. But I’d create a plan and if it’s viable, work the plan. But that sounds awful lol"
UNLV,I would be more worried about having to accept a bunch of low earning rides like 3-4 dollars. Accept 50-60 rides at $4 and without a bonus you’re screwed in future offerings. Don’t worry it’s not them it’s the algorithm
UNLV,The 60 rides yes. Just put 5 mile radius and take all rides. I did 22 in like 6 hours last time.
UNLV,you will not even reach 95. They wanted you to accept every single poopoo rides and then they will stop sending you offers before you reach that number
UNLV,Pick up two people 1 mile away and drop them off continuously until you meet the ride quota. Give them a piece of the bonus.
UNLV,"In 4 days, In my markets, no. However, there is no way to opt out of these challenges. So, knowing they're going to throttle my rides anyway, I just choose the top one. That way, when they do throttle my rides, I will at least made quite a bit of money. And who knows, maybe they will forget. 🤷🏿‍♂️"
UNLV,If I pick the $840 challenge and I complete 60 rides does it pay me the $480?  That’s how I read it and even if I can’t do the 175 I can definitely do 60 and make the $480.  What am I missing?
UNLV,Assuming you accept every ride no matter the distance or amount… it’s still not achievable.
UNLV,Can you take the 840 challenge and just get the 60 rides? That's the best feasible bonus if no penalty.
UNLV,"Even if you're in the best market on the best weekend of the year it would be doubtful. I've hit 80 rides in a weekend, a couple of times, but its such a drag to drive that much, stay up late and consume all that caffiene."
UNLV,"I mean, you get half after 60 rides based on what i’m seeing so at least THAT part is possible. Double that? No, not really."
UNLV,"I've done 90 rides on 3-day weekend Uber quests, on several occasions. Assuming 12 hours on/6 hours off, you've got 48 hours of driving time over the weekend. 2,880 minutes/175 rides = 16.46 minutes/ride. 

The only reason I was able to hit 90 was that I declined trips over 24 minutes. Do you really think every single one of your trips is going to be 16 minutes or less? Not likely."
UNLV,I feel like it would make most sense to do this in miles in order to not discourage drivers from taking longer rides
UNLV,"175 rides over 3 days. That's about 58 rides a day. Assuming an average of 15 minutes per ride (it may be closer to 10 minutes im accounting for some time in between one passenger stepping out and the next stepping in), that's 14.5 hour days. 14.5 x 3 = 43.5 total hours for $840. That comes out to roughly $19 an hour for the privilege of working more than a 40 hour work week in 3 days. Screw asking if it's possible. Is that even worth it?"
UNLV,In the 2 weeks I've had lyft only done 1 pickup and it was 4 dollars LOL
UNLV,"Youd need to average 5.8 rides per hour if youre only allowed to drive 10 hour days, unless my math is wildly off."
UNLV,"I average 3-4 rides per hour during bar rush in my market, but the rush is really only about 5 hours a day.

I don't think this is remotely possible, even if driving 14 hours each day for 3 days.  The market would have to be 4 rides an hour just to make the bottom challenge.

You *might* be able to make the 115 rides and get +$3/ride, but that's a real stretch."
UNLV,"The only way this is possible is if it was during college semester, at USC they have Shared rides for students who want to get around campus, you'll be getting constant 2 to 3 dollar rides back to back, each less than a mile apart. Even then you'll be sick of it by 50 rides cause all the students are shit and slam your door, you'll question why you even drive."
UNLV,The Lyft algorithm will not allow anyone to fulfill whichever challenge you may pick. This is why I stopped driving ride share
UNLV,59 rides per day each ride can’t take more than 20 mims calculating a 12 hour workday.
UNLV,"Wait, do you get $480 for 60 rides on that option?"
UNLV,"Nope. They gave me the lowest option of 40 rides this weekend which is totally doable, but they’re offering 30$. Not even a dollar extra per ride. It’s ridiculous.

Last year I was able to pull 300+ daily with bonuses and now I’m lucky to get 200 and I have to drive 2-3 more hours"
UNLV,Does Lyft challenges let you unlock the first tier without the second? If so gun for the first 60rides atleast! (I don’t even try to complete Lyft challenges anymore why I don’t know the answer)
UNLV,"At 2-3 rides per hour if it doesn't f you over with nothing but let g rides for pennies and at most 48 hours of optimally used time available, at most you could do ~140 rides  maybe up to 160 if you get some lucky 5 minute 1 block rides scattered in there. But that's literally starting at exactly start time, no wait time between rides, maxing out your 12 hours, sleeping 6 hours to unlock another shift, no travel time, and going non stop."
UNLV,"$840 /175 =$4.8 a ride…… am I doing that math right?


Is this on top of what they make?"
UNLV,"For this kind of challenge, stay in OC. Every ride in LA tends to pay a little better but takes a lot longer because of traffic."
UNLV,If you get a long ride that’s good that means you’ll out earn the challenge
UNLV,"12 hours of 3$ rides at 10 minutes each would be 60-72 rides a day. It’s possible, but challenging. Then taking into account a 12 hour shift only requires a 6 hour rest, so you can go another 6 hours in the 24 hour period. It can be done"
UNLV,60 rides fetchez $480 from the firsr tier of that promo. Why not?
UNLV,"175 rides is impossible, but if you get $480 bonus for 60 rides, that's easily the best value here"
UNLV,60 rides a day for three days…? What the fuck
UNLV,I’ve done this on Uber. Just take all short rides.
UNLV,"  ? You guys do know how software works? It can be manipulated by the creators to their advantage. That's why a lot of Tech people start thinking their Gods like a Doctor. I'm just saying, no matter what you pick.

     What can stop them from ending your goal you chose? In other words, once they see you getting close to the goal. They stop showing you rides of new pickups or force you get a lot of rides that aren't worth it."
UNLV,Stop driving Lyft.  Let them go out of business and then Uber will need to be regulated
UNLV,I used to do these and like my last few rides would be hours away. Making me have to drive back to my city and try to find another by the dead line
UNLV,Assuming each ride took 13 minutes you would have to work 12.6 hours a day for 3 days with 0 breaks
UNLV,Another reason why I no longer drive for Lyft here in Phoenix Arizona.
UNLV,"Please don't attempt to do this nonsense. 

They know damn well you can't do 175 rides in 3 days, but if you try to get it done, you'll do a shitload more rides than you typically would in a weekend. It's a way to make you work more with no incentive."
UNLV,"In my area, on a good day, I could get 3 rides per hour. I tend to max out at 23 rides or a little over 7 hours per day. Driving in excess tends to bear down on my sensory issues, causing me to be irritated. There is no way I would be able to achieve this. That's why I quit Lyft."
UNLV,"I’m not sure of your market, but on the weekend in Dallas, I usually average 3.75 rides per hour. So that would be 47ish hours. Would be difficult here anyway. 🤷🏼‍♂️"
UNLV,Then you will get less ride ..so Lyft doesn't have to pay the bonus .
UNLV,What the fuck?   175 rides in 3 days?
UNLV,"My strategy is based on which property I am at and how far away the rideshare pickup spot is.  


Places like Cosmo have the rideshare pickup spot conveniently located so I use rideshare, places like the Linc or the Venetian, even Paris where the pickup location is less convenient, I find myself grabbing a cab real quick.  


For me it's all about convenience in the moment, not one overarching decision."
UNLV,"Most of the cab drivers are Dick Heads I had one guy watching a soccer match on his dash driving me all the way downtown from the airport. And they long haul you 

Most of the Uber and Lyft people are pretty good and you can always compare the two. Sometimes they get you on surge pricing but I’ve never had a problem with it.."
UNLV,Taxi from the airport an ride-share the rest of the trip.
UNLV,"Taxis are flat rate from the airport to your hotel/casino (Plus taxes/fees/gratuity):

https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG

Does need to be a direct trip though - requesting to stop at Lee's/CVS/Walgreens on the way will probably get you hit with the metered rate plus waiting charge, etc."
UNLV,use taxis for travel from the strip to other local places near the strip including downtown. Use uber/lyft for off strip rides.
UNLV,"Definitely recommend taxis at the airport. The rideshare pickup area is a crowded mess, but the taxi stand is super quick and organized, even during busy times."
UNLV,"We got a taxi from the airport to the Strip and it was a flat rate of $24. 

For the rest of the trip we took Uber everywhere.  There are literally Ubers waiting at the hotels so you don’t wait long at all.  Very easy to get around."
UNLV,Big facts here in vegas.  There's nothing and on top of that no streak bonuses ... but even ride bonuses..WTF
UNLV,I've had no safety issues with either Uber or Lyft.  I just get annoyed at the wait times sometimes.  I prefer taking the bus from the airport when I'm staying south-strip... no safety issues there either.
UNLV,FYI sometimes a cab is actually cheaper and faster than rideshare. After a concert on Halloween it was over $50 for an Uber back to hotel and $15 for cab.
UNLV,"I always use Uber with others and alone in Vegas, never an issue"
UNLV,If I’m going between hotels or restaurants on the strip I take cabs. The placement of some of the u er/Lyft areas are not as easy to access at some hotels.
UNLV,Uber is my go-to transportation.
UNLV,"Taxis are still such a scam in Vegas. We went in October and the driver tried charging us an additional $7 above the posted rate. His excuse was that “they haven’t updated the signs with the latest prices” but he had a printed price sheet in the vehicle with inflated rates. Such a scammer! He was trying to charge us a flat rate of $26 to get from airport to Luxor. The uber cost us $13+tip. 

Taxis are just as unsafe as Ubers, and they’re notorious for ripping ppl off."
UNLV,"6 in one hand half a dozen in the other. Only story’s involving Uber or Lyft in the news here are passengers attacking drivers, so yea it’s safe."
UNLV,"The only time I might take a taxi over Uber/Lyft is from the airport to the strip. Sometimes the wait time for an Uber/Lyft is too long because you’ve got dozens of other people requesting one at the same time. The taxis from the airport are now a flat rate depending on which hotel on the strip you’re going to. They have the rates posted when you’re exiting the airport to go to the taxi line. For example, I believe we paid $25 flat from the airport to Paris. I think Uber/Lyft would still be cheaper if you don’t mind waiting, but when I arrive I am ready to get my vacation started so I don’t mind paying the extra to get moving right away.

Otherwise, Uber/Lyft is just fine for all your other travels within Vegas. It is safe, but as with any public transit, if you ever feel unsafe go with your gut. Between the two, Uber tends to be the cheaper service when I compare the two, but not by much. It also depends on surge pricing. If you have a Chase credit card, some of them offer 5% or 5x cash back on Lyft rides so that might be one reason to use Lyft over Uber."
UNLV,I spent $200 on uber in Vegas over memorial day weekend this year. Don't regret it. Haven't and don't use lyft in a while after I signed up for uber one.
UNLV,"I've used Uber a lot in Vegas, by myself or with my very elderly mother. Felt totally safe all the time. I tell her she's an Uber veteran. I've also used taxis there since 2000, and only had a minor issue once."
UNLV,I prefer Uber simply because I’ve had too many shady and slimy encounters when booking lyft. Including a scammer. Uber just worked better for us the last time we were there. Many drivers drive for both so it really shouldn’t matter.
UNLV,"Most drivers do both lyft and Uber.  You’ll see both logos on their dashboard.  Just pick whichever is cheaper. 

At most casinos the rideshare pickup will be at the back door.  Front is reserved for taxis because of years of graft."
UNLV,I feel safer in an Uber or Lyft than I ever did in a shitty taxi cab in Vegas
UNLV,I prefer lyft st the same price but whatever is cheaper. And it's always been safe for me
UNLV,"Both are very good, I always go by whoever is cheaper at the time I’m looking for a ride"
UNLV,What's not safe are the taxi's.. Amateur formula 1 drivers from small countries all over the world.
UNLV,"Check cab fair, since a lot of drivers jumped ship and went to ride share a lot of cab companies have adjusted rates to continue operating.
Any option would be acceptable."
UNLV,I'd use Lyft/Uber over a Taxi any day. I typically use Lyft while I'm out there but both methods of travel are safe. My encounters with the drivers have all been friendly.
UNLV,"Whichever is cheaper at that particular time. Honestly, taxis are faster and cheaper (mostly).  I hate having to wait for an uber or lyft, especially if it ends up being a bit more expensive"
UNLV,Taxi -- drivers have better stories.
UNLV,Taxi they are readily available and usually cheapest.  We were ubering in October.  But my 20 flat under ride to a casino was 15 in the taxi for the return trip.
UNLV,"I just got back from vegas and used Ubers the whole times, bit confusing finding the right pickup spot at first in bigger casinos - for either me or the driver. Leaving, the uber surcharged to $47 and the cab was $25 flat rate to the airport. So sometimes a cab can be cheaper."
UNLV,"I prefer taxi's .. the ubers and lyfts are always in crazy places but if you remotely know the city just take a taxi and it's fine.. figure 15 bucks to go anywhere but clear across the strip or to the raceway.  If they say ""i know a short cut just say no"""
UNLV,"Definitely check both at the airport.  Last time I flew in, Uber was almost double Lyft for the same trip due to surge pricing."
UNLV,"First 3 years I lived here, I didn’t have a car and primarily used Uber and Lyft. No issues. Use whatever is cheaper at the time of the ride. Hardest part is trying to find the ride share area at whatever casino you’re leaving from."
UNLV,"I usually pick whichever is cheaper and/or can arrive fastest. In my experience, there's never been a safety issues aside from a couple of super aggressive drivers."
UNLV,"Whichever can pick me up faster in the non-upgraded vehicle.  They are extremely safe.  I know you didn't ask, but I would (and do) choose ride share services over a cab every time.  In my experience cabs are not as clean, cabs are usually in worse mechanical condition and I have been ripped off by cab drivers several times that take non-direct routes.  Never had a problem with Lyft or Uber."
UNLV,I always do standard airport taxi to the hotel but Uber for different hotels and clubs on or off strip. The Uber rides have been great
UNLV,"Here is a map of flat rate pricing (for taxis) from the airport to resorts on the strip:

[https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider\_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG?n=698](https://taxi.nv.gov/uploadedImages/taxinvgov/content/Rider_Info/ZonesQuickMap.JPG?n=698)

Depending on location, fares are between $19-$27 (plus tip, plus $1 fuel charge, plus $3 if you use a credit card)

&#x200B;

Great overview of taxi pricing in Vegas:

[https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare](https://www.lasvegashowto.com/taxi-fare)"
UNLV,"It all depends cabs have been cheaper lately and are already parked waiting. Plus the price surge on Uber is insane for instance going to bellagio or leaving bellagio price hikes are insane, receipts to prove ."
UNLV,"They are both safe. Just make sure you check the plate and driver pic so you're in the right car. Recently, I've found Lyft to be cheaper, but you should check both apps everytime. For going to and from the airport, checkout the shuttles -- they are generally cheaper though you may have to wait a bit depending on when you arrive."
UNLV,"I am a retired professional chauffeur. (Limo driver, but extremely high end.) I do my best to never use Uber as they have not only charged me twice for rides, but then they also charged me for rides I never took. LYFT has never screwed me in any way. All the best of luck."
UNLV,"I personally prefer Lyft in Vegas because I find their service to be reliable and their drivers to be friendly. In terms of safety, both Uber and Lyft have safety measures in place, such as driver background checks and GPS tracking, which add an extra layer of security.

I also use [Vegas.com](https://govisit.click/vegas) for finding practically anything in Vegas lol. It's such a great, affordable option."
UPenn,"Is she a grad/med/law student? Otherwise, doesn’t really matter for undergrad since so many live on campus.

All busses run until about 12:30am, but some lines run all night. Could be once an hour or even less frequency, but they run.

Trolleys and subways also end around 12:30am. Though on weekends, MFL and BSL run 24 hours; I think starting Friday night.

Uber/Lyft are always available."
UPenn,"you can pre-book rides on uber. I'd recommend doing that, some drivers prefer the long routes and less busy town streets"
UPenn,I have gotten multiple Ubers from state to altoona no problem
UPenn,"trust me, there are student who take uber/lyft all the way to JFK.

I've seen it with my friends, heard of it

cost is about $600-800, but as long as driver accepts it then its good to roll"
UPenn,"I can only speak from the position of someone who used to take safety calls for one of these companies: Don’t. You’re better off delivering food or packages if you want to make extra money driving. 

There are drivers who have good experiences and make some extra money on the side but those are best case scenarios. There’s tons of things that can happen that will make these companies (or your car insurance company) leave you in the lurch.

I’ve talked to drivers who’ve had everything from bullets ripping through their cars cause their dumb ass passengers tried to use them as getaway vehicles from the dirt they were doing, to drivers who pull up to a domestic dispute and get a brick hurled through their window by some jilted woman. And with the increase in carjackings here in Philly, I wouldn’t risk it. 

Beyond that: wear and tear you put on your car isn’t worth it, and that’s before some clown pukes in your backseat or ruins your trunk/door slamming it."
UPenn,"Unfortunately, it's my full-time job until I land something more solid. I drive in South Jersey and Philly. Philly has become a little bit like the Wild West with all the car jackings.

Drive during daylight and in better neighborhoods. Before you start the ride turn off accepting other rides. Choose your areas carefully and be vigilant of people walking up on you, bumping into you, and of course, the potholes.

Stay safe!"
UPenn,"I live in Jersey but when I ubered in philly alot, I was not a huge fan. Especially going to certain areas. I straight up did not take rides to Kensington. I will say, I did enjoy picking up tourists though, and telling them places to go and talking to them. That was fun. Probably averaged 25 an hour. 

I stopped after a very very large woman with bedazzled jeans from wisconsin insisted on sitting up front, and she was so big that she barely fit in my mazda sedan and scratched the interior on the glove compartment with her gemstone jeans. 

Uber is not worth the wear and tear on your car in general."
UPenn,"I found a ""real"" job recently so I've stopped. Prior to that I was doing it full time overnight during quarantine and after. In a nutshell, you have to be choosy as hell and constantly vigilant. You need to be choosy because there's no point in driving 15 minutes to pick someone up trying to go 3 blocks away. You need to be vigilant because obviously the carjacking nowadays, but also while driving. Potholes made me have to swap out for a new set of tires twice in one year. Also, sometimes people are just straight up grimey. I specifically stopped driving old women around because some old lady's Depends leaked onto my backseat. Immediately took my car to a detailing shop and had them scrub my car over twice and sent the bill to Uber who was nice enough to credit me for the cleaning. Aside from that, I chose overnights because it's actually safer. Less drivers, all the roads are accessible, and if it's early in the night everyone's happy and has good energy and if it's really late then they're tired and won't really want to act up. Plus you get access to all the early morning airport runs which are much $$$."
UPenn,"Yes, but plan around 15 minutes for the nearest Lyft to make it to you."
UPenn,Booking in advance is also cheaper than finding a ride on time
UPenn,You can also reserve a future uber/lyft and they’ll assign someone to you to pick you up at that time so it’s guaranteed. I’ve never had an issue using this method.
UPenn,"I took an Uber from East Falls for a 6AM flight last week and it worked like normal. Caught it around 4, it was like $25-30"
UPenn,It depends where you live. Anywhere close to center city and or university city and you’ll get an uber in a matter of 5-10 minutes no problem
UPenn,I’ve done uber at 3:30am. It was fine
UPenn,"I still use old-fashioned taxis for this, have been burned by Uber before. 

Scheduled a pickup for 4:30am, Uber came at 4:15 instead while I was showering and then left at 4:20 because he was ""waiting too long"". 

At least with a cab, they'll wait for you, they'll load your bags, they'll actually know how to get to the airport (this has been a problem with Uber) and it'll always be the flat rate."
UPenn,"It’s serious, be surprise how many drivers will accept the ride.
Why do you think every year they cut the pay?"
UPenn,I’ve been wondering about upfront pay and tolls on Lyft. With Uber the upfront pay offer they give doesn’t include tolls but they still pay you for it so you know their offer is actually what you’ll net after tolls. Now my question is does Lyft do the same thing ? I’ve taken a couple of trips that I wondered about toll payment and couldn’t remember the offer for the life of me to compare it with the earnings after the fact.
UPenn,Get rides to NJ from Philly all the time. That’s weird it’s only $12? Usually there atleast $18-22 for me going over the bridge
UPenn,"Tolls are **NOT** included in that Up Front ""earnings"".

After you do a trip including a toll open the Ride Summary for it and you'll see that the Tolls are all passthru to you, on top of the ""earnings"" you were quoted Up Front.

Just make sure to keep track of the Tolls for tax purposes, as it'll look like income if you don't deduct the expense of the tolls."
UPenn,"Of course they are serious. We see that from the Jersey side constantly taking people to Philly. Then you guys get all the surging when the event is over and people need to come back. In addition, you can pick up rides on the way back. Jersey drivers can't.

Sounded harsh. Not at you, but it is definately a struggle from this side."
UPenn,"I live in Philadelphia, I drive in Pennsylvania. I’m just trying to straight up OPT OUT of rides that terminate in New Jersey! What paperwork do I have to submit? I don’t feel like doing it - maybe I will, but I’m definitely going to sign up for Uber first thing tomorrow morning. This app is telling me I can’t take a ride after I drop someone off in New Jersey! so much red tape… it wasn’t like this…."
UPenn,"Wish I knew about this a couple weeks back and paid for a lyft to an interview because I lowkey don't think I'm going to trust the subway for a long time. It was already on thin ice for me long before the pandemic for how gross it was half the time. I would have walked, but I was in a full suit. Ended up just walking home though"
UPenn,Lyft doesn't pay their drivers a fair wage or provide them adequate tools to stay safe on the road.
UPenn,I hope they compensate the drivers for the tips they will miss on these. I tried driving for Lyft a while back and its not worth it if a passenger doesnt tip.
UPenn,"What if I take a Lyft to an ""interview""  downtown, tell them I got the job, then do I get free lyfts downtown for 3 weeks? Because that's not a bad deal... And I like taking advantage of shitty companies like Lyft wherever I can"
UPenn,"If you can prove you have a job interview in a reasonable way, I'll pay your taxi fare both ways + lunch, as long as you ride with someone who has a real medallion. I know it isn't perfect, but its something.

Limit 3 people, because I'm not that far from broke as fuck myself.

PM me if you think I'm playin.

Edit: I also live in Oakland, CA but have mad love for Philly so....  


EDIT: Honestly I don't care if its a real medallion, Uber, Lyft, two swallows gripping you by the hair, or you jog and bang two coconuts together. If I can somehow help, I'd love to."
UPenn,"No Lyft car would show up when I was paying for it (one Saturday evening a few months ago).

They fooled me once."
UPenn,"Call me when Lyft or Uber or who the fuck ever decides to properly insure their drivers, then I’ll applaud. Great thing they’re doing with this program but their own business model has significant flaws that they need to focus on.

It’s fucking crazy that there are no checks and balances in place for that sort of thing.  People making money off this stuff realistically can’t afford proper coverage. Change my mind."
UPenn,"Remember when cabs provided a solid middle class wage, benefits, and were clean, safe, and regulated? 

Lyft turned a whole slew of careers into 1099 poverty ""jobs"" and is now trying to trick you into thinking they're on your side. They're not."
UPenn,"Job interviews were my number one reason for using a Lyft a few years ago.

I realize a lot of people drive for Lyft and Uber at the same time but I've always preferred Lyft."
UPenn,"I don't want to sound too negative but suffice to say I don't think you've actually done any meaningful research on this topic.  

You could have a very healthy debate around which university is ***the best*** for startup culture & opportunity. Perfectly valid discussion.  

But I don't think an argument can be supported that in any way suggests that UPenn is unprepared or inadequately prepared to help support a good startup idea.

UPenn,"As a PA driver, I rarely accept trips over 5-6 miles long anymore since pay on any trips more than 15-20 minutes skews revenue down to below the IRS standard deduction of $0.655 per mile. I'm in Philly, however, so I usually just stay local. I guess it depends on how your part of PA is laid out."
UPenn,Getting a ride home might be a different beast entirely
UPenn,In the past you might have had better luck 🍀 now with the consistent pay cuts to drivers it might be harder
UPenn,"You should be fine scheduling a ride, there should be a driver that will take the ride."
UPenn,"There are private car services that you can contact. It it is 4 or less pax you can get a sedan. Just Google private car service near me. 

Drivers make shit on long rides and don't do it cash either t
You don't be covered by driver insurance Incase if an accident, and these rideshare drivers don't have the seats to cover your medical."
UPenn,"Ask yourself if you would accept a job to drive to a stranger then give them a ride from eastern Pennsylvania 50 miles away, 75 minutes for $40-50 then drive back home. (100 miles, 2.5hrs) and the gas comes out of your $40-50. This is the likelihood of a driver hitting accept.

Reserving a ride doesn't guarantee anything but you might get really lucky and get a driver who wants that ride. Maybe they have plans or are heading in that direction anyways so they don't have to make the trip back.

A tip is expected so the driver at least makes some money for their time and service."
Northwestern,"Are you in DTC right now? If so, you talk to your professors about a place you need to travel for your project and then you take the Lyft there, so you don't have to pay for transit"
Northwestern,"I usually take the blue line a few stops then take a lyft from there, the prices go way down once you're away from the airport"
Northwestern,Blue line to red isn’t too bad of a train ride to Evanston edit: and about $2.75?
Northwestern,I always take a taxi! Much cheaper than uber
Northwestern,Just take the bus and ask ppl w a purple hoodie if they wanna split an uber should be tons of them at this time
Northwestern,Can’t help you there. But the [250](https://www.pacebus.com/sites/default/files/2023-10/Pulse%20Dempster%20Schedule%20Cover%20Sheet_Weekly%20Service%20All_0926SM_0.pdf) from Davis Street Station runs express now and only takes an hour. So if you’re looking to save money that’s the easiest and cheapest. A Lyft or Uber will be more like $40-50.
Northwestern,http://www.splitrideshare.com/ This originally matched people going to and from airports and NU. Looks like they upgraded it but i’ve used it a few times and it’s great
Northwestern,"People will tell you lyft or Uber but in my experience using O’Hare for the last 20 years, 303 taxis flat rate tends to be the cheapest. I ALWAYS check lyft and Uber just in case, but the flat rate from 303 taxi tends to be cheaper and you can look it up online"
Northwestern,take a taki trust me. they’re cheaper especially in the night time when uber and lyft rates are high. there’s a lot waiting right by the airport
Northwestern,"Depending on the time, an Uber or Lyft could be like $30"
Northwestern,taxi may be cheaper but uber/lyft/taxi are all safe. if anything uber & lyft are more secure if you’re worried about that but either way you’ll be fine.
Northwestern,uberx for 30-40 bucks assuming your stuff can fit in the trunk or backseat of the uberx.
Northwestern,"Uber or Lyft. Idk what other apps exist lol. Never had any issues in terms of safety. Just always ask the driver who they are picking up before getting in, as well as checking the plates 

For school breaks like thanksgiving when everyone is leaving and arriving at the same time a lot of people coordinate on fb etc to share ubers/lyfts so it’s cheaper."
Northwestern,Probably uber at that point? I have seen a few people lug suitcases on the intercampus bus.
Northwestern,"I always arrive to OHare but midway airport is also fine. Having said that, given that your are international your flight is most likely going to land in O hare so I don’t think you will get to choose that. There is many ways to get to campus (subway, bus, etc.), but do yourself a favor a take a taxi/uber/Lyft since it’s the first time you are coming and I don’t think the stress of figuring out the transportation system in a new place is worth it. Uber can go from $40-70 depending on the day/time. Regarding money bring $100 cash in case your cards don’t work and you will need to pay anything in cash."
Northwestern,"All of these are my own take from personal experience, so I can't guarantee they're the best. 

&#x200B;

I can't speak on how early you can fly in, although I do think international students get to come earlier.  I would recommend flying into O'Hare and taking a car to school (whether that's uber, lyft, taxi, etc.).  There are public transport options if that fits your budget better, but I personally hate getting on the bus/train with all of my bags.  I personally never use cash ever, but I would have like maybe $50 of emergency money in cash.  Good luck!"
Northwestern,"Ok so I’m my market LA flexdrive all included zero damage waiver (they’ve covered two nails in tires already charging and 90 personal miles (you can add more or keep the app running in the background declining requests) for an EV is a bit over $400 a week. You’re in for 20 rides min and get a $140 bonus if you do 90. Hitting 45-50 hours a week I make around $800-1000 a week profit. I have no worries about any other expenses except cleaning. Worth it to me but I work 70-80 hours a week between this and my other work. I always have but prefer doing this to just one job cause I’ve been in the same industry for 24 years, I was going through burnout and LA is pretty nice to drive around in."
Northwestern,"Buy a car. For real. It’s not worth it to rent. You’ll be working every day to pay that astronomical fee. 

Back in the day with Lyft the rental program was awesome. If you did 90 rides a week it was only $110 to rent. Unlimited miles. Whatever this express drive garbage is these days is asinine."
Northwestern,"NEVER rent through uber or lyft, you'll lose money in the long run."
Northwestern,"Why? Driver pay is being cut every single year. Customer support is abysmal, at best. Lyft's future as an ongoing company is in doubt due to its mismanagement.

As an independent contractor you are liable for your income and self employment taxes. 15.2% of your income goes to SE taxes, and that's before you even start paying income tax.

Driving Lyft is a losing proposition. Only a fool would sign up to drive full-time at this point."
Northwestern,"Rent a Car They Said. It will be fun, they said. Said No One Ever. 
Tesla 427.00 Per Week in the market, I drive in
Gas Vehicle not much cheaper. 

Do yourself a favor and buy something. But just know that the pay sucks. Not like it was in the early days of Goober. Uber/Lyft are taking 60 to 70%"
Northwestern,"for the cheapest options, there's always the train or the busses. However, if you text in the c/o 2026 groupme when you're coming in, people can split the Uber cost with you and make it significantly cheaper per persob"
Northwestern,"If you want to avoid Uber, the best option would be Pace 250. 
Since you're international student, I assume you will arrive at terminal 5. Took the skytrain (ATS) to MMF (Multimodal Facility) then wait for Pace 250.
Ride 250 until Davis Station. If your housing is around south campus, I suggest you just walk from Davis Station.
But if your housing in north, I prefer to take L train - Purple line from Davis and stop at Noyes. (But you have to buy ticket or ventra in order to use L train)"
Northwestern,"Ubers from airport have been more expensive lately, I think because of gas prices."
Northwestern,"Pace 250 if you want to do public transit, I’ve only ever done it with a carry on size piece of luggage though. American taxi is the cheapest taxi I know of. Look them up and call ahead to book a ride a few days before you flight and they will give you a price. Last year I think it was around $35 for a van (I had two passengers and six pieces of luggage, so requested a larger vehicle)"
Northwestern,"Ubers from the airport are either really expensive or fairly cheap. A lot of times really expensive. Always open the app to try though. If push comes to shove, you can take CTA Blue line to the Loop, switch to Red line toward Howard, and switch to Purple line at Howard to get to Evanston. Look at Lyft too. The CTA commute is a doozy."
Northwestern,Taxi from the airport will be cheaper than an uber if you don't want to sit on the bus or train for a millenium.
Northwestern,"If you want a faster ride, you could take the blue line to the loop (Jackson), then red line to Howard and purple to Foster. At that point its just a walk east to campus. However, taking the L does involve more transfers and a bit more expensive.

Otherwise, the 250 will work just fine, but it is a bit further walk to campus. I've lived in Chicagoland all my life and taken both the L and CTA, so if you got any more questions about the area/etc I can help."
Northwestern,try posting it on [https://collegesouk.com/](https://collegesouk.com/) there's ride-sharing!
Tufts,I should write a bot to buy/sell stock in Uber based on MBTA alerts.
Tufts,Gotta get that Lyft XL
Tufts,I should drive for Lyft.
Tufts,Uber diamond coming in strong. 20 dollars to get me to work here.
Tufts,Comparable Uber:  $125.99
Tufts,And the driver gets $20 of that ride.
Tufts,Look at how many cars there are. There was simply not enough drivers to handle the demand.
Tufts,r/BostonRideShare
Tufts,https://www.lyft.com/drivers/KAYLA538?utm_medium=d2di_iacc guaranteed $950!!!! Also passengers use DRIVERSMAKEBANK TO GET $5 off!!!
Tufts,There are these cars with drivers called taxis that by law do not change their pricing during busy times. I'd suggest calling one since nobody else is.
Tufts,Stop using Lyft/Uber then?
Tufts,Uber/Lift are perfectly reliable at that hour. 
Tufts,"Depending on how much luggage you have, and how early you need to get there, public transportation wouldn't be too bad. I've never taken an uber that early so I can't speak to its reliability. If you don't mind paying extra, there are several cab companies in the area that you can reserve a day in advance if you want extra piece of mind. I've taken a cab from Tufts to the airport countless times, and it's usually $40."
Tufts,Uber / Lyft should be fine especially now that with at least Uber you can schedule a pick-up. I usually just wing it and request a ride 15 minutes prior to when I need to leave the house to catch 7AM flights and haven't had a problem yet. 
Tufts,"Uber is very reliable, I've gotten rides to the airport at like 3-4 am with them after maybe a 5 minute wait of requesting."
Tufts,"I live right next to Tufts and I have taken Uber to the airport a couple times. You're in luck because it's a ridiculously easy and fast ride, without traffic you can be door to door in 15 minutes. You just hop on 93 S. and it takes you right there.

If you take UberPool it will only be about 12 bucks (or less if you get UberPlus)

I have found Uber and lyft to be very reliable nearly 24/7

"
Tufts,You can reserve uber-x ahead of time. No need to do anything else
Tufts,"From Tufts Uni:

Walk or get an Uber to Davis, depending on your location. 

Ride Red Line to South Station

Silver Line to Logan.



Honestly if your looking to catch a flight, take an Uber at around 5-6 am. The traffic is less and it's usually done with the overnight surge. You can just stay at the airport and do work or just chill. I got to Logan 4 hours early, and I just played Civ V until my flight. 


Edit: Uber's about $20. I live near Tufts (Hillside) so I'm assuming it might be the same/less."
Tufts,"Public transportation is a reliable way to get to the air port from there. Walk to davis, then red line to silver line. Considering you'll be leaving early, the T should not be too crowded by that point. But traffic will also be light, so Uber would be faster."
Tufts,"In April the sun sets at about 19:30 in Boston, something to keep in mind. You say you'll be over-caffinated, but be aware that the T shuts down at midnight. 

Will you have a Tufts ID? You can get into some museums like the MFA for free with a university ID. 

Newton: Get off the T at Eliot and meander through the neighborhoods to Newton Centre. Will give you a good flavor.  
PRO TIP: if you have an unlimited ride pass take the B to Chestnut Hill Ave and walk to Reservoir and change to the D or take the C to Cleveland Circle and walk to Reservoir. The views from those trains are much better than on the D, and those stations are like 5 minutes apart, and will give you a much better idea of the city. Take the B one way and the C the other. B goes by BU and where younger people live (Allston/Brighton). C goes through Brookline which is a wealthier area, but much denser than Newton. 

You can cover Big Dig (Greenway), Downtown, Back Bay, Harvard, and MIT in a day if you push yourself. If you take the SL1 from the airport to South Station you'll actually go through one of the Big Dig projects. 

Being brown: In the places you're mentioning there is no reason to be concerned. You have to remember that Boston welcomes a ton of people like you every year. Problems with police are also not as bad in Boston as in other areas of the US. If you're still nervous, buy a sweatshirt or hat that says ""Tufts"" on it and and you'll be invisible. 

Hiking: honestly I would make this the first thing you cut from your trip for time. Unless you've never been in a forest before it's not that impressive.

If you want to splurge go see a Red Sox game."
Tufts,"I love the Back Bay area. I would recommend taking the redline to Park Street, walk through the Commons to the public garden then walk down Comm Ave for maybe 4-5 blocks in the middle greenway, and then switch to Newbury St (still walking in the same direction to Mass Ave. there’s great people watching on Newbury. When you get to Mass Ave, take a left and stop at Pho Basil for excellent Vietnamese/Thai food. It’s usually packed so takeout might be best. Keep walking down Mass Ave and go to Wally’s Cafe (if it’s open) for some great live jazz. Be careful wandering too much around Wally’s at night. Methadone Mile isn’t far away and there can be a fair amount of crime. I’d probably take an Uber when leaving Wally’s if it’s late. 

I also love walking around Castle Island. Hell, really just walking around Boston. No better way to see a city, especially Boston being so walkable"
Tufts,"If you’d like to see the “burbs” I would take the C and D lines of the Green Line. Take the C to Coolidge Corner and walk all around. Get bagels at Kupels (just ranked one of the best in the country), donuts at Union Square (not my FAVORITE in the city but still delicious), pizza at Ottos, or a sandwich at Zaftigs. Then get back on the C and ride up to Cleveland Circle and do the same. If it’s nice enough, walk from CC to the BC campus. Then get on the D at Reservoir (right by Cleveland) and ride west. Best option would be Newton Centre. Then just meander there for a while. 

And don’t worry about race. Boston’s racism isn’t outright and awful like the south. It’s more intrinsic and long standing in financial and economic which shouldn’t affect you in terms of your visit. 

Overall though just enjoy! You’ll love it"
Tufts,"You've clearly done your research and I'd say you're sure to have a blast here! There's already a lot of good suggestions here but I'll add some advice as well.

Your itinerary looks *packed*. I don't know what your symposium schedule looks like but make sure to leave some time to hang out with some of the other students there! You'll presumably be meeting a bunch of very smart people, so that's gonna be fun itself.

From Medford, you'll probably be taking a bus or walking to the red line for most locations. You sound like a transit enthusiast, and there are a lot of us here. The MBTA could be better but once you get to the trains, it works pretty well most of the time. It's great for exploring the city, but I would bear in mind that it's going to take you ~30 minutes to get into the city center, where you'll have to transfer to get to a lot of different locations. You can definitely get wherever you want to go, but you can pack more things in the closer you look to where you'll be staying. I'll echo what others are saying about Davis. Lots of cool places, and it's close, which will be very helpful timewise. That said, I'd definitely spend a day just wandering downtown if you can. Get off the red line at Charles/MGH, and walk down Charles St. to the Common. From there, you can go through Downtown Crossing to the North End (grab a bite to eat here if you can), then you can walk along the shoreline in either direction to your heart's content. I'd circle around to the Seaport district, which is new and a bit ""fake"" but does have some cool stuff to do.

I know you mention that you'd be okay sleeping very little to explore more but there's not much to explore after midnight. Boston is a very early city, and it's not always easy to get around without a car after 12:30. I've had success using Blue Bikes to get home late, but that's not really a great way to get all the way out to Medford, *especially* if you've been at bars. Ridesharing apps like Uber/Lyft work well but can get pricey. Don't know how much you've budgeted for getting around while you're here, but rideshares can add up quick depending on when you're ordering them.

I'd second others mentioning that you should have some destination when you're headed out to the burbs. You can for sure go for a nice walk out there (I used to run out to Brookline/Newton a ton when I lived in Fenway) but unless you're in a built up area it's mostly just houses. Brookline in particular has a nice balance of suburban homes and things to do, so personally I'd take the D branch to Beaconsfield/Reservoir and walk around Fisher Hill if you want to see a wealthy suburb still in T-range. It'll take you a ~45min-1hour to get there from Medford, and if you wanted to walk around Newton Centre it would take you about an hour to get there on the T.

If you want to do NYC you will have to budget 4-5 hours of travel both ways (once you account for the 30 minutes from Medford to/from South Station), which means that to really do it efficiently you'd have to take a bus/train early in the morning and late the next day. That's a lot of time traveling (8-10 hours) given that you're only here a week and a half but I've done more travel in less time so you just have to weigh that versus what you could be doing in Boston during that time. I grew up in NJ so I've taken every possible mode of transportation between Boston and NYC (well, I haven't sailed between the two, but you get the point). Amtrak is best but also usually most expensive, for some reason. Buses are very hit or miss experience wise but tend to be the cheapest by a wide margin.


On point **c**- I don't think you'll run into issues. Boston has a (sometimes deserved) reputation as a racist city but a lot of the issues are systemic. Not saying that we don't have racist individuals here either, but they're not too common and you shouldn't run into issues as a tourist.

On point **d**- I'm one of the many students that came to school here (at Northeastern) and stayed after I graduated. College parties can differ a lot depending on what college you go to and what your friend group looks like, but in my experience, partying at a college in the city involves going an apartment, drinking a little (or maybe a lot), and talking to whoever ends up in your line of sight. It's a mixed bag, depending on who's hosting. Sometimes it's a blast, sometimes you leave early to get blitzed at your favorite bar instead.

Hope this helps! If you have any other questions feel free to ask. I know this ended up a bit rambly but I travel in the same way (just exploring around) so I hope this helped give you a lay of the land a bit."
Tufts,"Hi there! Congratulations on getting into the program at Tufts!!! It's so cool to hear your excitement at coming to the city! You will be in Medford/ Somerville, as you know, but the area is really cool. You'll be close to Davis Square (I worked there for a long time) which has wonderful restaurants and shops. There is a lot to do and see there, and it is probably the closest t station to Tufts as well. Everything is super walkable. 
For the best views of Boston and Cambridge, rent a blue bike and ride along the bike paths that are on Memorial Drive (Cambridge side) and Storrow Drive (Boston side). They go along the Charles river and you can see the city skyline, and there are parks along the river, it's so nice.  The Fells are the closest trails to you, but definitely check out Blue Hills if you get the chance, and because I'm biased (I work in Jamaica Plain and live in Roslindale) I am going to recommend the Arnold Arboretum too.  It's not a forest, it's a reserve run by Harvard with trees and plants from around the world, and in April all the plants start waking up-- spring in the arboretum is so beautiful!! (It's very close to the Forest Hills t stop on the orange line too!)
The South End and Jamaica Plain are probably the best neighborhoods to look for queer nights at bars, but again that's just close to my part of Boston-- folks in Somerville will be able to tell you where to go around there.
Have so much fun!!!"
Tufts,"It'll be hard to fit in NYC unless you're adding more time outside of the program. That said, you could try to arrange to fly in/out of NYC and take Amtrak to/from Boston on your way in or out of the US. It's a scenic ride. That way you don't have to add a round trip to NYC in the middle of your visit. Note that Amtrak can cost $100+ each way on top of your flights.

You can technically ride Amtrak for free between Back Bay and South Station (it's like a 5 minute ride, you won't see much but you can say you did it, lol). 

Like some others have said, the suburbs you mentioned might not be the best use of your time. You can get some of the same vibe walking parts of Cambridge like Avon Hill or Mt Auburn Street (between Harvard and the cemetery). The yards aren't suburban big but it's very residential and New Englandy. 

Edit: forgot you'd be around Medford, you might find that area will also satisfy your ""suburbs"" itch as it's still pretty distinct from ""downtown"""
Tufts,"I've used many rental programs the best is from rideshare rental .
You have to really drive 7 days a week 12plus hours to make it worth it"
Tufts,"They wont tell you this, but on top of the ride requirement per week and the $1000.00+ a month just on the rental cost alone, no gas included, renters only get paid half the rate a driver does that uses their own vehicle."
Tufts,"Renting through a rideshare company is a horrible deal. In my market, it would take 2-2.5 *days* of working to pay the weekly rental fees."
Tufts,"You can get it, pay the 400 a week, get the zero deductible, get the personal miles, and drive 20 trips while, for 4 days, to and from, working for an Amazon job paying 18 or more dollars....while working some other gig app that pays better and get in 20 rides before the end of the week.

They require you pay down the cost of the rental before you actually earn any income...which is stupid because you have no gas money, cleaning, or food money until you pay off the car.. hints you add in personal miles, however many you'll need, and use those to get paid since you are new and bounes aren't a thing until you do a certain number of trips.

Well, at least that is what it was for me ..no bonuses showed until I was over 100 trips and had a great score with customers..which is also stupid because they lie a lot to get you kicked from the platform as they be something of stupidity that need a Lyft or Uber to get to work yet screw drivers that are willing to give them the rides..having cameras matter and living in a one party consent to recording state matters.

End of week is how long you have to get those 20 rides..which start on Monday and ends on Monday of the following week.

Come September 11th, is a date they say rental changes are coming, as in cost not an end... I suppose. Figure they are either raising the price, 400 dollars a week is outrageous already, or giving out incentives for rental drivers. I would not bet on the second one... because that would make too much of a benefit to us drivers who make them money as they don't have to rely on customer's tips as we do because they take 80 to 90 percent of the money charged to customers.

I am having a ragging clue its a screwing coming real soon and 9/11 is the date they chose....America get screwed again in the gig economy...I literally can't afford to work lyft full time with the stupid cost before income is earned.. not sure why they would not just take 40 or half earnings each day while you widdle down the cost of the rental... also gave out more funds to renters.. the major issues you have to consider are if you are young, in shape, and willingness to work 5 or more painful jobs just to survive or can you be OF girl that earn 30k per month doing the laziest job in the world getting paid like a lot of art BS jobs that don't really contribute to society..such as Athletes, artists, designer clothing brand maker, idiot influencer on social media, politicians and the list goes on....LOL"
Tufts,"You honestly don't need a car. Between the joey and the T, the cost of the two or three tickets you will likely get doesn't outweigh the convenience of grabbing a Lyft or the occasional zip car when needed. Everything is within walking distance. If you want to go longer distances just use a zip car."
Tufts,"1. Most people take uber or lyft instead of taxis.
2. You can get around the city by the train (we call it ""the T""), but don't rely on it if you need to be anywhere at a certain time. You can get to Medford by train and bus for sure.
3. The city has lost a lot of its soul the past decade. In its place is ""Guy Fieries Taco Bites"" and ""Cheeky monkey brew / barcade."" Basically, corporate restaurant groups are killing out small businesses. 
4. That said, the North End is worth a visit (even if one family owns a majority of it). Cafe Victoria, Stanza Sigari, Aqua Pazza, Regina Pizzeria, Bova's Bakery, ect. are solid spots.
5. Harvard and/or Central Square are worth visiting (in Cambridge the town on the other side of the Charles)
6. Becon Hill is kind of cool. Fenway Park is great (but drink before you go in). Near Fenway you have the MFA and Elizabeth Gartner Mueseams, which are  always cool to see."
Tufts,"You can get a 7 day T pass from the MBTA and it's $22.50 for unlimited rides. Otherwise it's $2.40 per ride. You can just do one ride from the airport, blue line shuttle to the blue line then pay your $2.40 and then it's a free transfer at Government center to the green line to get to Tufts. If you want to do stuff in Boston like the MFA, then you can use the weekly pass to get around. Of course there's always Uber and Lyft too, but I hear they occasionally cancel and you get stuck waiting for another one. Mind as well just wait for the T. In addition to the Harvard museum of art which is free, there's also the Harvard Museum of Natural history which is not free, but both accessible by T. There's also Institute of Contemporary Art which is free Thursday nights from 5-9pm but you should reserve tickets the day of. The Mapparium is also interesting.

Tufts,"Biking in Boston is super dangerous, and Boston drivers are murderous assholes.  That said Blue Bikes, our bikeshare program, are a super convenient (necessary?) way to fill in the gaps of the crumbling transit system, and a good way to see the city if it doesn't kill you.  Boston's also super nice for walking.  Get out at North Station, go to Bova's for canolli, check out the Fanuel Hall slave market (don't buy anything; go to Public Market if you're hungry) and make you're way to Acorn Street for the Gram, at which point, one could hit a dispensary and/or packie (liquor store -- just remember to drink discreetly in public here) and head down to the river.

If you're into international cuisine, definitely eat all the Mexican, Dominican, and Brazilian food everywhere around where you're staying.  More in surrounding towns but Everett, Chelsea, Revere, Somerville all have a lot of really good restaurants run by recent and not so recent immigrants from Latin America that are probably better than what you're gonna find in France.  We have great Lebanese restaurants too, but you can get that at home.  Unfortunately, you'll have to bike or figure out buses (the consensus on this sub seems to be that the Transit app is the best for that), because Boston lacks good transit between outlying areas without going back into the hub.  There's Haitian places in Somerville and Cambridge that might be fun for a Francophone too.  

Harvard art museum is free, the other museums in the city probably have passes you might be able to get from the library at Tufts.  Definitely check out the Arboretum too.  It's not the Tuileries, but it's not exactly a strictly utilitarian botanical garden either."
Tufts,"One of the airport tunnels is closed so it’s best to take public transportation out of the airport, then get an Uber 

Depending on the location of your hotel, you could:
-take the silver line to South Station, then the red line to Davis Square or
-Take the blue line to State and then take the orange line to Wellington 
And pick up an Uber from there.

Whenever I bring gifts to France, I like to go to a store called Old Navy & buy t-shirts or tote bags with American flags on them. There is one located on the Downtown Crossing stop on orange or red line train.

Also when I’m downtown, I check out the Army Navy store for flag stickers or magnets.

There’s other tourist shops downtown that I like to grab stickers/ magnets that say Boston & have lobsters on them 🦞

I also like to bring Boston Red Sox gear (our Major League Baseball team). I usually find towels, t shirts, sometimes hats at the Marshall’s & TJ Maxx stores at Downtown Crossing.

In terms of activities for yourself, what do you like to do at home?"
Tufts,"Without knowing exactly where you're hostel is, Tufts is very accessible by public transportation (green like, and to some degree maybe the red line depending on where you will be). The only payment is that our system right now is underground a lot of maintenance, because it is old. It has required trains to make less trips, speed restrictions, and sometimes even transfers to bus. It's all feasible, but will depend on your timing. If you are traveling for work, definitely opt for a cab or Uber to keep it easy.

As to a recommendation for a take home momento, what do you like? Food? Something to remind you of the city? Clothes?"
Tufts,"Yes, public transportation will be significantly cheaper. I've never gone from airport to Medford, so I don't have a good read on that. It does seem high, but don't take my word for it.  The ride itself should not be a long ride, unless you are flying in during peak commuting times. Then it might be a long journey due to traffic jams. That's the bad part of having an airport close to the heart of the city.

For food.. Most iconic Boston foods aren't the most transportable (seafood), unless you look for something a little kitschy like Fluff (spreadable marshmallow) or Lobster shaped candy or treats. I can't say we make any stellar wines, but we do have a number of popular local breweries. Sam Adams is the big local brand sold nationally, but there are a number of microbreweries. I don't drink, so I'll leave it to others who might be able to recommend ones they like. Some do sell cans of their own beer.  This link might help in the meantime.

https://www.massbrewersguild.org/breweries"
Tufts,"I used to live right by Tufts and have taken a cab from the airport back to my place. Took around 20ish minutes and was $25 with tip. Bonus was that there is usually at least 1-3 cab waiting in the taxi line while if you go with rideshare you have to wait. Just make sure the taxi guy starts the meter and doesn’t offer you a flat fee, always take the meter.

A bunch of good food reccs have been made but if you are looking for good italien subs check out Bobs Italien. It’s so worth the money and I would get 2 extra meals because they give you so much food."
